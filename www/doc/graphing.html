<h2>Graphing Package</h2>

part of the <a href="index.html">ArsDigita Community System</a>
by <a href="http://eve.arsdigita.com/">Eve Andersson</a>

<hr>

This "package" only consists of one main procedure (and a couple little
supporting procs and gifs) that creates bar charts in plain html with 1x1
pixel gifs stretched to the right width and height.  It will work on any
browser that supports tables (i.e., pretty much all of them).

<p>

This package relies on a few gifs being
present in /graphics/graphing-package/.  It also relies on the
presense of ad_proc and its helper procs in utilities.tcl.  Make sure
you always have the latest version of utilities.tcl every time you
upgrade the ACS! The graphing Tcl procedures are in /tcl/ad-graphing.tcl.

<p>

If you want to do fancier charts like x-y-scatter graphs or pie charts,
you should probably buy/find/write a cgi program that generates gifs
on the fly (a popular free example is Gnuplot, distributed from
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/gnuplot_info.html">http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/gnuplot_info.html</a>).  In my experience, trying to do these the plain html way
is very slow and limited.

<p>

The bar chart procedure, <code>gr_sideways_bar_chart</code> returns
an HTML fragment.  It has just one mandatory
argument, although there are a number of optional arguments to beautify
or improve your graphs.  Because there are so many optional arguments,
the optional arguments are specified using flags (keyword arguments), like
Unix commands, instead of positionally like most tcl procedures.
<p>

To run this command: 

<blockquote>
<code>gr_sideways_bar_chart <i>subcategory_category_and_value_list</i></code>
</blockquote>

<p>

To use optional arguments, for instance <code>legend</code> and 
<code>left_heading</code>: 

<blockquote>
<code>gr_sideways_bar_chart -legend <i>legend</i> -left_heading <i>left_heading</i> <i>subcategory_category_and_value_list</i></code>
</blockquote>

The arguments:

<ol>

<b><li><code>subcategory_category_and_value_list</code></b><br>
This is the only mandatory argument.

<p>
To create a graph like this:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>Dogs</b>
Samoyed    xxxxxxxxxxx 45%
Black Lab  xxxx 20%
Terrier    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 66%
<b>Cats</b>
Calico     xxxxxxxx 39%
Persian    xx 10%
</pre>
</blockquote>

supply <code>subcategory_category_and_value_list</code> as a Tcl list of lists:

<p>

<blockquote>
<code>
<pre>
[list [list "Samoyed" "Dogs" "45"] \
      [list "Black Lab" "Dogs" "20"] \
      [list "Terrier" "Dogs" "66"] \
      [list "Calico" "Cats" "39"] \
      [list "Persian" "Cats" "10"]]
</pre>
</code>
</blockquote>

</p>


Dogs and Cats are the categories, Samoyed, Black Lab, Terrier, Calico, and
Persian are subcategories, and all the numbers are values.  You can have multiple
values per subcategory, in which case you should supply the values as a list:

<blockquote>
<code>[list [list "Samoyed" "Dog" [list "45" "65" "34"]] ...]</code>
</blockquote>

<p>

There can be an optional fourth argument, which specifies a URL to
link around the value displayed (if values are being displayed). If
provided, this overrides the setting of <code>default_drilldown_url</code> below.

<p>

<b><li><code>legend</code></b><br>
<code>legend</code> is a list of what the values refer to if there's more than one value
per subcategory.

<p>

So, if you have created a graph with three values per subcategory:

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>Dogs</b>
Samoyed   xxxxxxxxxxx 45%
          ----------------------- 90%
          ++++++++++++++++++ 70%
Black Lab xxxx 20%
          ------ 30%
          ++++++++++++ 60%
</pre>
</blockquote>


then create a legend like

<blockquote>
<code>[list "March" "April" "May (projected)"]</code>
</blockquote>

<p>

<b><li><code>bar_color_list</code></b><br>
There is a default list of colors with which the values will be displayed
if there is more than one value per subcategory, but if those
colors don't meet your design needs, go ahead and supply your own color list.

<p>

<b><li><code>display_values_p</b></code><br>
By default, the values (like 60%) aren't displayed after the bars, but if you
want them to be, set this to "t".

<p>

<b><li><code>display_scale_p</code></b><br>
By default, there's a scale displayed at the top of the chart that goes from
0% to 100%, but if you don't want that scale there, set <code>display_scale_p</code> to "f".
It doesn't make sense to have the scale if the values that are being charted
are not percentages.

<p>

<b><li><code>default_drilldown_url</code></b><br>
If supplied, should be a URL to which the numeric value (if being displayed) will be linked.
This variable will undergo variable expansion, so <code>$category</code>, <code>$subcategory</code>, 
and <code>$value</code> may be referenced.

<p>

<b><li><code>non_percent_values_p</code></b><br>
Set this to "t" if the numbers you're charting are not percentages.  Then
this procedure will, instead of creating bars that are a fixed number times the
value, display the values relative to each other (it will, in essence, pretend
that the highest value within a category is 100%, and then display the other 
values in that category relative to each other).

<p>

<b><li><code>min_left_column_width</code></b><br>
If you are going to stack charts, set the <code>min_left_column_width</code> to be
the same for each of them so that they will line up.
Otherwise, the left column, which contains the categories and subcategories, probably
won't be the same for successive charts.

<p>

<b><li><code>bar_height</code></b><br>
By default, the height of each bar is 15 pixels.

<p>

<b><li><code>subcategory_spacing</code></b><br>
By default, the spacing between each subcategory is 7 pixels.

<p>

<b><li><code>compare_non_percents_across_categories</code></b><br>
This is only relevant if you are graphing values that are not percentages.
Usually (as explained above for non_percent_values_p), the bars are drawn so that
they are relative only to other bars in the same category.  This makes sense
if one category has values like 900, 854, 942, and another totally unrelated
category has values like 2.5, 3, 3.27.  You wouldn't want the bars in the second
category to be drawn relative to the ones in the first category because they
would be very small and, besides, they're not even related.  But, if the numbers
ARE related across categories, then set <code>compare_non_percents_across_categories</code>
to "t".

<p>

<b><li><code>left_heading</code></b><br>
Stuff (text/pictures/whatever) that goes above the items on the left of
the chart (i.e. above the categories and subcategories).

<p>

<b><li><code>right_heading</code></b><br>
Stuff that goes above the items on the right of the chart (i.e. above the values).

<p>

<b><li><code>replace_null_subcategory_with_none_p</code></b><br>
Set this to "t" to have "[none]" be displayed as the subcategory if the
subcategory is the empty string.
