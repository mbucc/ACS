  <h3>Acquire Oracle 8.1.6 Enterprise Edition</h3><p>
You can obtain the software through a variety of methods.
<p>

<ol>  
   <li>Order a CD from the <a href="http://store.oracle.com/">Oracle Store</a>.  There is a link under
the heading <em>Buying Tips</em> that says "Learn how to trial Oracle software."  Click this for 
instructions on how to make your order.  The cost is currently $39.95 with delivery estimated between
3-4 business days.<p>
   <li>Request a free demonstration CD.  At the <a href="http://technet.oracle.com/software/products/oracle8i/software_index.htm">Oracle Downloads</a> page, click on the appropriate version of Oracle 8.1.6 Release 2 for
your OS.  You should see a "Try Online" link.  After filling out some information forms, you should
be able to order a version of the CD.  This takes about 2-3 weeks for delivery.<p>
   <li> You can download Oracle from the Technet <a href="ftp://ftp.oracle.com/pub/www/otn/">ftp site</a>.  The Linux version is at  <a href="ftp://ftp.oracle.com/pub/www/otn/linux/oracle8i/oracle8161_tar.gz">ftp://ftp.oracle.com/pub/www/otn/linux/oracle8i/oracle8161_tar.gz</a>.<p> Note that the Oracle tarball that you will download is huge (&gt; 250Mb). 
<p><ul>
    <li> Oracle 8.1.6 now comes with a Java RunTime Environment built-in to the distribution, so you no longer have to download and install it separately.<p>

    <li>After the download is complete, untar the file to a convenient
	location.  To do this, you will need to login and cd to the
	directory where the archive is.
<pre>
$ cd /directory/where/oracle/is
$ tar -xzvf oracle8161_tar.gz
</pre>
</ul>
  </ol>
<p>
  <a name="advice"></a>
  <a href="#top">TOP</a><br><h3>Things to Keep in Mind</h3><p>

  Throughout these instructions, we will refer to a number of
  configurable settings.  We will advise certain defaults.  With the
  exception of passwords, we advise you to follow these defaults
  unless you know what you are doing.  Subsequent documents will
  expect that you used the defaults, so a change made here will
  necessitate further changes later.  For a guide to the defaults,
  please see <a href="#defaults">Appendix 3</a>.
<p>

  <a name="pre-install"></a>
  <a href="#top">TOP</a><br><h3>Pre-Installation Tasks</h3><p>

  Though Oracle 8.1.6 has an automated installer, we still need to
  perform several manual, administrative tasks before we can launch
  it.  You must perform all of these steps as the <b>root</b> user.
  We recommend entering the X window system as a user other than
  <b>root</b> and then doing a <code>su -</code>.  This command gives
  you full root access.<p>

  <ul>
    <li>Login in as a non-root user.<p>
    <li>Start X by typing <code>startx</code>.
    <li>Open a terminal window type and login as root.
	<pre>
$ su -
; Enter the <b>root</b> password when prompted.
#
</pre>
    <li>Create and setup the <b>oracle</b> group and <b>oracle</b> account.<p>
    We need to create a user <b>oracle</b>, which is used to install the product, as well as starting and stopping the database. <p>
<pre>
# groupadd dba
# groupadd oinstall
# groupadd oracle
# useradd -g dba -G oinstall,oracle -m oracle
</pre>
	Now change the <b>oracle</b> account password<p>
<pre>
# passwd oracle
</pre>
      You will be prompted for the New Password and Confirmation of that password.<p>


    <li>Setup the installation location for oracle<p>

    While Oracle can reside in a variety of places in the file system,
	ArsDigita has adopted '/ora8' as the base directory.<p>

    <b>Note:</b> the oracle install needs about 1 Gb free on '/ora8' to install successfully.


<pre>
# mkdir /ora8
# cd /ora8
# mkdir -p m01 m02 m03/oradata/ora8
# chown -R oracle.dba /ora8
# exit                  ; Logs out.
</pre>
  <li>Set up the <em>oracle</em> user Environment<p>

  <ul>
    <li>Log in as the user <b>oracle</b><p>
	In the same terminal window, type the following.
	<pre>
$ su - oracle
; Enter oracle's password
</pre>

    <li>Use a text editor to edit the <b>.bash_profile</b> file in the
	<b>oracle</b> account home directory.
	<pre>
$ emacs ~oracle/.bash_profile
</pre>
You may get this error:
<pre>
Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
Xlib: Client is not authorized to connect to Server
emacs: Cannot connect to X server :0.
Check the DISPLAY environment variable or use `-d'.
Also use the `xhost' program to verify that it is set to permit
connections from your machine.
</pre>
If so, do the following.	
<pre>
Open a new terminal window.
$ xhost +localhost
Now, back in the oracle terminal
$ export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0
$ emacs ~oracle/.bash_profile
</pre>

Try this procedure anytime you get an Xlib connection refused error.
<p>
	
    <li>Add the following lines to this file:<p>

<pre>
export ORACLE_BASE=/ora8/m01/app/oracle
export ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_BASE/product/8.1.6
export PATH=$PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:/lib:/usr/lib
export ORACLE_SID=ora8
export ORACLE_TERM=vt100
export ORA_NLS33=$ORACLE_HOME/ocommon/nls/admin/data

umask 022
</pre>
Save the file by typing <code>CTRL-X CTRL-S</code> and then exit by
	typing <code>CTRL-X CTRL-C</code>.  Alternatively, use the
	menus.<p>

    </ul>

    Make sure that you do <b>not</b> add any lines like the following

<pre>
# NLS_LANG=american
# export NLS_LANG
</pre>

    These lines will change the Oracle date settings and will break
    the ArsDigita Community System (ACS) because ACS depends on the
    ANSI date format, YYYY-MM-DD dates.<p>

    <li>Log out as oracle.<p>
<pre>
$ exit
</pre>
	
    <li>Log back in as oracle and double check that your environment variables are as intended.<p>
<pre>
$ su - oracle
$ env | grep ORA
</pre>
If it worked, you should see:
<pre>
ORACLE_SID=ora8
ORACLE_BASE=/ora8/m01/app/oracle
ORACLE_TERM=vt100
ORACLE_HOME=/ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6
ORA_NLS33=$ORACLE_HOME/ocommon/nls/admin/data	
</pre>
If not, try adding the files to <code>~oracle/.bashrc</code> instead
	of <code>.bash_profile</code>.  Then
	logout and log back in again.  Also, be certain you are doing
	<code>su -</code> and not just <code>su</code>.  The
	<code>-</code> means that <code>.bashrc</code> and
	<code>.bash_profile</code> will be evaluated.<p>

      Make sure that<b> /bin</b>, <b>/usr/bin</b>, and
	  <b>/usr/local/bin</b> are in your path by typing:
	  <pre>
$ echo $PATH
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/X11R6/bin:/home/oracle/bin:/ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6/bin
</pre>
If  they are not, then add them to the .bash_profile by changing the
	  PATH statement above to <code>PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:$ORACLE_HOME/bin</code><p>
    </ul>


  <a name="install"></a>
  <a href="#top">TOP</a><br><h3>Installing Oracle 8.1.6 Server</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Log in as the user <b>oracle</b> and start X if not already running.<p>
<pre>
Start a new terminal
$ xhost +localhost
$ su - oracle
Enter oracle password
$ export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0
</pre>

    <li>Find the 'runInstaller' script.<p>

    <ul>

     <li>If you are installing Oracle from a CD-ROM, it is located in the 'install/linux' path from the cd-rom mount point<p>

<pre>
$ su - root
# mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
# exit
$ cd /mnt/cdrom
</pre>

<li>If you are installing from the tarball, the install script is
    located in the 'Oracle8iR2' directory that was created when you expanded the archive.<p>
<pre>
$ cd /where/oracle/archive/is/Oracle8iR2
</pre>
</ul>
Check to make sure the file is there.
<pre>
$ ls
doc  index.htm  install  runInstaller  stage  starterdb
</pre>

If you don't see <code>runInstaller</code> you are in the wrong directory.
<p>
    <li>Run the installer.<p>

Congratulations, you have just installed Oracle 8.1.6 Server!
  However, you still need to create a database which can take
  about an hour of non-interactive time, so don't quit yet.


<a name="db"></a>
<a href="#top">TOP</a><br><h3>Creating the first Database</h3>
This step will take you through the steps of creating a customized
  database.  Be warned that this process takes about an hour on a
  Pentium II with 128 MB of RAM.
  <ul>
  <li>
  Make sure you are running X.  Open up a terminal and su to oracle and
  then run the <code>dbassist</code> program.

  <pre>
$ xhost +localhost
$ su - oracle
; Enter oracle password
$ export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0
$ dbassist
</pre><p>



  <li>The "Welcome" screen in the Oracle Database Configuration Agent (ODCA).<p>

  <ul>

    <li>Select "Create a database."<p>

    <li>Click "Next."<p><br>

  </ul>

  <li>The "Select database type" screen in the ODCA.<p>

  <ul>

    <li>Select "Custom."<p>

    <li>Click "Next."<p><br>

  </ul>

  <li>The "Primary Database Type" window in ODCA.<p>

  <ul>

    <li>Select "Multipurpose."<p>

    <li>Click "Next."<p><br>

  </ul>

  <li>The "concurrent users" screen of the ODCA.<p>

  <ul>

    <li> Select "60" concurrent users.<p>

  <li>Click "Next."
</ul>
      <p>

  <li> Select &quot;<b>Dedicated Server Mode</b>&quot;. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>

  <li> Accept all of the options, and click &quot;<b>Next.</b>&quot;
      Oracle Visual Information Retrieval may be grayed out.  If so,
      you can ignore it.  Just make sure that everything else is checked.<p>

  <li> For &quot;Global Database Name&quot;, enter &quot;<b>ora8</b>&quot;. For &quot;SID&quot;, also enter &quot;<b>ora8</b>&quot; (it should do this automatically). Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>

  <li> Accept the defaults for the next screen (control file location). Click  &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>

  <li> Go to the &quot;<b>temporary</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>rollback</b>&quot; tabs, and change the Size (upper-right text box) to <b>150</b>Mb. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>

  <li> Increase the redo log sizes to <b>10000K</b> each. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>

  <li> Use the default checkpoint interval &amp; timeout. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>.&quot;<p>

  <li> Increase &quot;<b>Processes</b>&quot; to <b>100</b>; &quot;<b>Block Size</b>&quot; to <b>4096</b> (better for small Linux boxes; aD uses 8192 on the big Solaris  machines).<p>

  <li> Accept the defaults for the Trace File Directory. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>

  <li> Finally, select &quot;<b>Save information to a shell script</b>&quot; and click &quot;<b>Finish</b>.&quot; (we're going to examine the contents of this file before creating our database.)<p>

  <li> Click the &quot;<b>Save</b>&quot; button.  Oracle will
      automatically save it to the correct directory and with the
      correct file name.  This will likely be
      <code>/ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6/assistants/dbca/jlib/sqlora8.sh</code>.  <p>

  <li> It will alert you that the script has been saved successfully.<p>

  <li> Now we need to customize the database configuration a bit.
      While still logged on as <b>oracle</b>, edit the database
      initialization script (run when the db loads).  The scripts are
      kept in <code>$ORACLE_HOME/dbs</code> and the name of the script
      is usually <code>init<i>SID</i>.ora</code> where <i>SID</i> is the SID
      of your database.  Assuming your $ORACLE_HOME matches our
      default of <code>/ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6</code>, the
      following will open the file for editing.
<pre>
$ emacs /ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6/dbs/initora8.ora  
</pre>

<li> Add the following line to the end:<p>

<pre>
nls_date_format = &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;
</pre>

  <li> Now find the <code>open_cursors</code> line in the file.  If
      you're using <code>emacs</code> scroll up to the top of the
      buffer and do <code>CTRL-S</code> and type
      <code>open_cursors</code> to find the line.  The default is
      <b>100</b>.  Change it to <b>500</b>.
      

<pre>
open_cursors = 500
</pre>

  <li> Save the file.  In emacs, do <code>CTRL-X CTRL-S</code> to save
      followed by <code>CTRL-X CTRL-C</code> to exit or use the menu.<p>

  <li>At this point, you are ready to initiate database creation.  We
      recommend shutting down X to free up some RAM unless you have
      256 MB of RAM or more.  You can do this quickly by doing a
      <code>CRTL-ALT-BACKSPACE</code>, but make sure you have saved
      any files you were editing.  You should now be returned to a
      text shell prompt.  If you get sent to a graphical login screen
      instead, switch to a virtual console by doing
      <code>CRTL-ALT-F1</code>.  Then login as <b>oracle</b>.
   
  <li> Change to the directory where the database creation script is
      and run the script.
      <pre>
$ cd /ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6/assistants/dbca/jlib
$ ./sqlora8.sh
</pre>
In some instances, Oracle will save the file to <code>/ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6/assistants/dbca</code>.  Try running the script there if
      your first attempt does not succeed.<p>
  <li> Your database will now be built. It will take &gt; 1 hour. No fooling.  You will see lots of errors scroll by (like: &quot;ORA-01432: public synonym to be dropped does not exist&quot;) Fear not, this is normal.<p>

  <p>Eventually, you'll be returned to your shell prompt. In the
      meantime, relax, you've earned it.<p>

</ul>

<a name="testing"></a>
<a href="#top">TOP</a><br><h3>Acceptance Test</h3>
For this step, open up a terminal and su to oracle as usual.  You
should be running X and Netscape for this step.
<ul>

  <li> You need to download the &quot;Oracle Acceptance Test&quot;
      file. It's available <a href="acceptance-sql.txt">here</a> and at <a
      href="http://philip.greenspun.com/wtr/oracle/acceptance-sql.txt"
      >http://photo.net/wtr/oracle/acceptance-sql.txt</a>.  Save
      the file to <code>/tmp</code>.<p>

  <li> In the oracle shell, copy the file.<p>

<pre>
$ cp /tmp/acceptance-sql.txt /tmp/acceptance.sql
</pre>

  <li> Once you've got the acceptance test file all set, stay in your term and  type the following: <p>

<pre>
$ sqlplus system/manager
</pre>

SQL*Plus should startup.  If you get an <code>ORA-01034: Oracle not Available</code> error, it is because your Oracle instance is not running.  You can 
manually start it as the <code>oracle</code> user.
<pre>
$ svrmgrl
SVRMGR> connect internal
SVRMGR> startup
</pre>


  <li>Now that you're into SQL*Plus, change the default passwords for system, sys, and ctxsys to "alexisahunk" (or change them to something  you'll remember):

<pre>
SQL> alter user system identified by alexisahunk;
SQL> alter user sys identified by alexisahunk;
SQL> alter user ctxsys identified by alexisahunk;
</pre>

  <li>Verify that your date settings are correct.
<pre>
SQL> select sysdate from dual;
 
</pre>
      If you don't see a date that fits the format
      <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>,
      please read <a href="#wrongdates">this section.</a>.<p>

  <li> At this point we are going to hammer your database with an
      intense acceptance test.  This usually takes around 30 minutes.
<pre>
SQL> @ /tmp/acceptance.sql

; A bunch of lines will scroll by.  You'll know if the test worked if
; you see this at the end:

<p>

Many people encounter an error regarding <code>maximum key
      length</code>:
      <pre>
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-01450: maximum key length (758) exceeded
      </pre><p>
This error occurs if your database block size is wrong and is usually
      suffered by people trying to load the ACS into a pre-existing
      database.  Unfortunately, the only solution is to create a new
      database with a block size of at least
      <strong>4096</strong>.  For instructions on how to do this, see
<a href="#db">Creating a new database</a> above.  You can set the
      parameter using the <code>dbassist</code> program or by setting
      the
      <code>DB_BLOCK_SIZE</code> parameter in your database's creation 
      script.
      <p>
      
      
If there were no errors, then consider yourself fortunate.  Your Oracle installation is working.<p>

</ul>
<a name="automating"></a>
<a href="#top">TOP</a><br><h3>Automating Startup &amp; Shutdown</h3>

You will want to automate the database startup and shutdown process. It's probably 
best to have Oracle spring to life when you boot up your machine. <p>

<ul>
  <li>Oracle includes a script called <b>dbstart</b> that can be used to automatically
start the database.  Unfortunately, the script shipped in the Linux distribution does not
work out of the box.  The fix is simple.  Follow these directions to apply it.  First, save 
<a href="dbstart.txt">dbstart</a> to <b>/tmp</b>.  Then login, and su to <b>oracle</b>.
<pre>
$ cp /tmp/dbstart.txt /ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6/bin/dbstart 
$ chmod 755 /ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6/bin/dbstart 
</pre>
  <li> While you're logged in as <b>oracle</b>, you should configure the <b>oratab</b> file
  to load your database at start.
  <li> Edit the file <b>/etc/oratab</b><p>

  <li> You will see this line.
<pre>ora8:/ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6:N</pre><p>
  By the way, if you changed the service name or have multiple databases, the format of this
  file is<p> <code><i>service_name</i>:<i>$ORACLE_HOME</i>:<i>Y || N (for autoload)</i></code><p>

  <li> Change the last letter from &quot;N&quot; to
      &quot;Y&quot;. This tells Oracle that you want the database to
      start when the machine boots.  It should look like this.<p>
<pre>ora8:/ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6:Y</pre><p>
  <li> Save the file &amp; quit the terminal.<p>

  <li> You need a script to automate startup and shutdown.  Save 
      <a href="oracle8i.txt">oracle8i.txt</a> in /tmp.  Then login as
      <b>root</b> and install the script.
<pre> 
$ su -
# cp /tmp/oracle8i.txt /etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle8i
# chown root.root /etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle8i
# chmod 700 /etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle8i      
</pre>

   <li> Test the script by typing the following commands and checking
       the output.

<pre>

; You should see:
oracle8i       	0:off	1:off	2:off	3:on	4:on	5:on	6:off
</pre>

<li> You also need some scripts to automate startup and shutdown of
    the Oracle8i listener.  The listener is a name server that allows
    your Oracle programs to talk to local and remote databases using a
    standard naming convention.  It is required for Intermedia Text
    and full site search.<p>

      <li><a href="listener8i.txt">listener8i.txt</a>
    </ul><p>
    Now issue the following commands (still as <b>root</b>).
<pre>
# su - oracle
# cp /tmp/startlsnr.txt /ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6/bin/startlsnr
$ cp /tmp/stoplsnr.txt /ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6/bin/stoplsnr

$ chmod 700 /ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6/bin/stoplsnr
$ exit
; You should now be back as root.
# cp /tmp/listener8i.txt /etc/rc.d/init.d/listener8i
# cd /etc/rc.d/init.d
# chmod 700 listener8i

<p>
    Test the listener automation by running the following commands
    and checking the output.

<a href="#top">TOP</a><br><h3>Appendix A: Troubleshooting Oracle Dates</h3><p>
Oracle has an internal representation for storing the data based on the
number of seconds elapsed since some date.  However, for the purposes
of inputing dates into Oracle and getting them back out, Oracle needs
to be told to use a specific date format.  By default, it uses an 
Oracle-specific format which isn't copacetic.  You want Oracle to use
the ANSI-compliant date format which is of form <b>'YYYY-MM-DD'</b>.<p>
To fix this, you should include the following line in 
<b><code>$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/init<i>SID</i>.ora</code></b> or for the default
case, <b><code>$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/initora8.ora</code></b>:
<pre>
nls_date_format = "YYYY-MM-DD"
</pre>

You test whether this solved the problem by firing up <b>sqlplus</b>
and typing
<pre>
SQL> select sysdate from dual;
</pre>

You should see back a date like <code>2000-06-02</code>.  If some
of the date is chopped off, i.e. like <code>2000-06-0</code>, everything
is still fine.  The problem here is that <b>sqlplus</b> is simply 
truncating the output.  You can fix this by typing
<pre>
SQL> column sysdate format a15
SQL> select sysdate from dual;
</pre>

If the date does not conform to this format, double-check that you
included the necessary line in the init scripts.  If it still isn't
working make sure that you have restarted the database since adding
the line if you didn't do it prior to database creation.<p>

If you're sure that you have restarted the database since adding the
line, check your initialization scripts.  Make sure that the following
line is not included <p>
<pre>
export nls_lang = american
</pre>

Setting this environment variable will override the date setting.  Either
delete this line and login again or add the following entry to your
login scripts <em>after</em> the <code>nls_lang</code> line. 
<pre>
export nls_date_format = 'YYYY-MM-DD'
</pre>

Log back in again.  If adding the <code>nls_date_format</code> line
doesn't help, then let <a href="mailto:bquinn@arsdigita.com">me</a>
know about it.

<a href="#top">TOP</a><br><h3>Appendix B: Useful Procedures</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Dropping a tablespace<p>

<ul>

    <li>run sqlplus as the dba

<pre>
$ sqlplus system/changeme
</pre>

    <li>To drop a user and all of the tables and data owned by that user:

<pre>
SQL> drop user <em>oracle_user_name</em> cascade;
</pre>

    <li>Drop the tablespace.  This will delete everything in the tablespace overriding
        any referential integrity constraints.  Run this command only if you want to
	clean out your database entirely.  

<pre>
SQL> drop tablespace <em>table_space_name</em> including contents cascade constraints;
