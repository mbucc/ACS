<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

We want a standardized and efficient way of asking the following kinds
of questions:

<ul>
<li>does this document or message contain R-rated words?

<li>does this user-contributed message include photography-related words?

</ul>

Note that this is distinct from categorization of content as implemented
in the <code>categories, site_wide_category_map</code>, and
<code>users_interests</code> tables.  This package was original aimed at
identifying content that includes naughty words.

<h3>The Medium-sized Picture</h3>

Any content on an ACS system can be tagged.  A tag is an integer, and
its exact length in bits is the maximum size of a Tcl integer.  The tag
is generated at the time that content is inserted into the
database (or edited).  In the case of a document that contains 100,000
words, tagging might be expensive.  So we want to do it once and then
have many people use it.

<p>

If BowdlerizeP is set to 1 in the ad.ini file, we store a bowdlerized
version of the content in a separate column, typically with the same
name as the original column plus a suffix of <code>_bowdlerized</code>.
For example, in the Chat system, we keep <code>msg</code> and
<code>msg_bowdlerized</code>.  The <code>_bowdlerized</code> column will
be NULL unless there was actually some naughtiness in the original.
Each naughty word will have been replaced with the character string in
BowdlerizeReplacementPattern ("***" by default).  So applications can
query with something like
<blockquote>
<pre><code>
select nvl(msg_bowdlerized, msg) as filtered_msg from chat
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

Each user in the community has a mask associated with his account,
stored in the <code>content_mask</code> column of the
<code>users_preferences</code> table.  This is an integer, whose maximum
length is the same as that of the content tags.

<p>

When a user tries to look at a piece of content, his mask is bit-ANDed
with the content's tag, and if the result is non-zero, further
investigation is required before the user can see the content; in
particular, the <code>adct_tag_mask_mismatch</code> procedure 
is invoked to decide what to do.

<h3>Standard Bits</h3>

Standard interpretation of bits:

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><th>Bit Pos<th>Interpretation</tr>
<tr><td align=right>0<td align=right>PG-rated</tr>
<tr><td align=right>1<td align=right>R-rated</tr>
<tr><td align=right>2<td align=right>X-rated</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

Note that an X-rated word would carry a bit vector of "111" since it
raises a problem in all three categories.

<h3>Configuration Parameters</h3>

<pre>
; for the Naughty Package
; (PG|R|X)LogP=1 logs the potentially offensive material
; (PG|R|X)BounceP=1 prevents the offensive material from being posted at all
; Note that in generally, you can't bounce only PG and X, but not R,
; the scripts find the lowest allowed naughtiness to bounce or log.

<h3>Data Model</h3>

<pre><code>
-- if upgrading from an older version of the ACS
alter table users_preferences add content_mask integer;

create table content_tags (
    word               varchar(100) primary key,
    tag		       integer not null,
    creation_user      integer not null references users,
    creation_date      date
);

-- for cases when users are posting naughty stuff 

create table naughty_events (
    table_name            varchar(30),
    the_key               varchar(700),
    offensive_text        clob,
    creation_user         integer not null references users,
    creation_date         date,
    reviewed_p            char(1) default 'f' check (reviewed_p in ('t','f'))
);

create table naughty_table_to_url_map (
    table_name      varchar(30) primary key,
    url_stub        varchar(200) not null
);
