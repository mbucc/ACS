<h2>general cleanup</h2>

This document was written on February 28, 2000.  It contains
miscellaneous things that we want to clean up in the ACS.

<h3>Integer primary keys everywhere</h3>

Jeff Davis claims that our magic scheme for pointing from, say,
general_comments to other tables, is causing trouble with the Oracle
query optimizer because it doesn't like to coerce from varchars to
integers.  There are only a handful of tables that use varchar keys
(notably bboard) so we should just root out the evil and have done with
it.  If you think that you might end up breaking links from elsewhere
on the Web, remember to leave behind a legacy_key column and make the
scripts appropriately robust.


<h3>approved/disapproved/unexamined</h3>

The unexamined life may not be worth living but to better support
workflow among a group of site admins, we need to make sure that we are
using three-valued logic consistently:

<ul>
<li>an item starts with an <code>approved_p</code> column value of NULL
(unless there is autoapproval configured with an "open" policy in
ad.ini); this means that nobody has looked at it

<li>an administrator is presented with a bunch of items in this state
and can push them into "t" or "f" (approved or explicitly disapproved)

<li>we always record by whom approved 

<li>once items are approved or disapproved, they disappear from the
queue of things to look at (though we will have admin pages for digging
out all the stuff when necessary)

</ul>

<h3>Push stuff out of /admin/</h3>

We want to be able to delegate admin authority for virtually every
module.  So the day-to-day admin stuff should be in, for example,
/neighbor/admin/ rather than /admin/neighbor/.  Anyone with site-wide
administration privileges ought to be able to work in /neighbor/admin/
and, if they have site-wide privs, the links anchored by user names
ought to point to /admin/users/one (so that the site-wide admin can
actually ban or nuke the user)

<h3>No more incremental ns_writes</h3>

Our customers are using ACS for sites with millions of hits/day.  In
general, we should not be doing explicit ns_writes while holding a
database handle.  With rare exceptions, every page should be
accumulating a string of some sort, releasing the database handle, and
then ns_return'ing the complete page.

<p>

In fact, what I'd like to see is the .tcl pages not calling ns_return at
all.  They should return a data structure (see <a
href="templating-etc.html">templating-etc.html</a>) containing the
string that they've produced and a tag saying "I'm a complete HTML page"
or "I'm a fragment of HTML that needs to be wrapped in a site-wide
template" or whatever.  For compatibility with old code, we can tell
that a Tcl script is just calling <code>ns_return</code> or
<code>ns_write</code> because it will return the empty string, 0, or 1.

<h3>LDAP compliance</h3>

Lars wrote a thing for Siemens to authenticate ACS users from an
external system.  This is exactly the same problem as LDAP integration.
I want Lars's code packaged up and documented and stuck into ACS,
ideally with the next release.  It doesn't matter if it is
comprehensive, just the hooks and a doc are enough to help adopters and
to claim victory.


<h3>Bookmarks module should deal with HTTPS</h3>

Aure and Dave should extend bookmarks to distinguish between HTTPS and
HTTP bookmarks (right now they both end up in the system without being
distinguished).

<h3>File storage module shouldn't recompute sort keys after an update</h3>

Right now file storage recomputes all the sort keys after an update.
This is obviously not going to scale to thousands of files very
gracefully.

<h3>A modest proposal:  one content table</h3>

How about one single content table?  Instead of bboard, news,
static_pages, etc. each storing user-uploaded content, just put
everything that we might ever serve back to a user all in one big
table.  This will make it easier to build an Intermedia index.  This
will make approval, etc., potentially more consistent.

<p>

If Oracle were a true object database, we could have tables that
inherited from the <code>all_content</code> table but supplemented it
with extra columns (e.g., <code>refers_to</code> in the case of
<code>bboard</code>).  But Oracle isn't so we will probably have to
resort to kludges like the _info helper tables that we have for
user groups.

<p>

Some ideas:  

<ul>

<li>think about related links; we have to keep the content (a short text
string) plus a title, <em>plus</em> some annoation (brief description)

<li>for attachments it probably makes more sense to have two content
pieces, one for the thing and another that is "attached".  This means
that a content item must be able to be a BLOB plus have all the extra
data associated with an image, for example

<li>in some cases we like to build a B-tree index on the content itself,
which won't work with LOB datatypes, so we might have to denormalize out
the first few hundred bytes or something if we need to do this

<li>BLOB versus CLOB versus NCLOB?  If we're going to be international,
we'd better figure out which is the right thing to use

<li>speaking of international, we need a column to store which language
the content is in

<li>Let's try to figure out whether Oracle 8.1.6 fixes the
"import/export doesn't work with LOBs" bug (feature); -- I read the docs 
and, sure enough, this is covered as a feature:

<blockquote>

"If LOB data resides in a tablespace that does not exist at the time of
import or the user does not have the necessary quota in that tablespace,
the table will not be imported." --

</blockquote>

<li>Let's try to figure out if we can really stomach the pain of having
nearly all of our data in an Oracle data type that does not support SQL
(i.e., the LOB).  We won't be able to do LIKE or WHERE = or anything
else with our content :-(


</ul>
