<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

<blockquote>

AOLserver 3 removed a lot of functionality from AOLserver 2.3.3 that
ACS depends on.  We've either copied implementions from our AOLserver 2.3.3
installation or reimplemented them from scratch.

<p>

You'll need to have <a href=???>000-aolserver-3-specific</a> in your
tcl library, which is in <code>/tcl</code> in a typical ACS installation.

<p>

You'll also need to have the newer 2.0 or later version of the ArsDigita
<a href="http://arsdigita.com/free-tools/oracle-driver">Oracle Driver</a>

<p>

Tcl page support is also needed.  You can either pick up 
<a href="http://www.dqd.com/~mayoff/aolserver/">Rob Mayoff's
Tcl page module</a>, which is a C-based add-on which includes caching
of tcl pages, or the original <a href=???>file</a>.
<i>??? Maybe just include file's guts in 000-aolserver-3-specific ???</i>

<h3>Inittab Changes</h3>

<blockquote>

If you have more than one AOLserver process which has the same
server name (e.g. photonet.ini has a server named photonet, and
photonet-dev.ini also calls its server photonet), you need to 
<strong>not</strong> use the <code>-k</code> (kill) option
in inittab.  AOLserver 3 stores the process ID (pid) in 
<code>log/nspid.servername</code>.  If there's two servers with
the same server name, they'll end up trying to kill each other.
(need more coherent explanation of why)

</blockquote>



<h3>.ini Changes</h3>

<blockquote>


To make ns_register_adptag work (which includes things like
<code>&lt;codeexample&gt;</code> defined in
<code>teaching-defs</code>) you'll need to have this configuration
file entry:

<blockquote><pre>
[ns/server/photonet/adp/parsers]
fancy=.adp
</pre></blockquote>

By default, AOLserver 3 uses the plain ADP parser which doesn't support
things like streaming, the &lt;script&gt; tag, and registerested ADP
tags.  The fancy parser adds these back in.

<p>

To make your log files roll in a Y2K compliant fashion, be sure you
have a <code>rollfmt</code> which uses <code>%Y</code> (4 digit year)
and not <code>%y</code> (2 digit year):

<blockquote><pre>
[ns/server/photonet/module/nslog]
RollFmt=<strong>%Y</strong>-%m-%d-%H:%M
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

You no longer need to suppy a <code>systemScope=on</code> entry in
the <code>[ns/threads]</code> section.
