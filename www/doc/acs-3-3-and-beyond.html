<h2>ACS 3.2 Developers' Guide to ACS 3.3 and Beyond</h2>

by <a href="mailto:jsalz@mit.edu">Jon Salz</a>
<hr>

This document tries to answer the question, "What the heck have you done to my beloved
ACS?" It briefly describes the changes made to ACS between versions 3.2.3 and version 3.3,
from a developer's standpoint.
It is intended to contain the minimal set of new information with which
<i>everyone</i> needs to be familiar to develop for ACS 3.3.

<h3>Big Picture</h3>

In the past, ACS has been a toolkit held together by loose conventions.
While this has worked well up to the present, ACS has matured to the point where it needs
to be more heavily structured.

One of our main goals for versions 3.3 and 4.0 is to add this structure - to develop
valuable conventions and clean abstractions that will help preserve ACS's
status as the best open-source toolkit around for developing
purposeful online communities.

<h3>In a Nutshell</h3>

<ul>
<li>The filesystem is reorganized, and the bootstrapping process changed, due to
<a href="#packages">package management</a> features.
<li><a href="#startup">ACS startup</a> isn't as simple as it used to be.
<li>A single <a href="#request-processor">request processor</a> (not an <i>ad hoc</i> series of filters and registered
procedures) now handles every single request to the site. <b>You must use
<code>ad_register_filter</code> and <code>ad_register_proc</code> rather than
<code>ns_register_filter</code> and <code>ns_register_proc</code>!</b>
<li>The <a href="#database">Database Access API</a> has been improved.
<li>A new <a href="#documents">document API</a> will be taking over
<code>ReturnHeaders</code>/<code>ns_write</code>/<code>ns_return</code> shortly.
</ul>

Note that aside from the <code>ad_register_*</code> changes, you are merely encouraged,
not required, to use the new APIs. As of 4.0 (and all code integrated into
ACS as packages) you <i>will</i> need to use the new APIs. The next few months
will be a transitional period.

<h3><a name=packages>Package Management and the Filesystem</a></h3>

One of the most fundamental changes to ACS starting with version 3.3
is the introduction of package management,
and the reorganization of the filesystem
(see the <a href="core-arch-guide/apm">ACS Package Manager documentation</a> to learn why this is
a good idea). Looking at the ACS 3.3 directory, you'll
notice a new <code>/packages</code> directory (at the very top of the directory tree, right
alongside <code>/tcl</code> and <code>/www</code>. The idea is to divide ACS into a series of
functional components, "packages," with each package mapped to its own
directory inside the <code>/packages</code> directory. The ACS core package
(<code>/packages/acs-core</code>) provides the very basic functionality expected
of an ACS system.

<p>It is outside the scope of this document to describe how to develop a package

(but if you're interested, see the <a href="core-arch-guide/apm">APM
documentation</a> or the <a href="packaging">5-Minute Guide to
Packaging Your Module</a>)

We're not asking anyone to build packages yet - just keep developing as you always have
been for now, in the same directories, but know that a lot of files you might expect to see
in <code>/tcl</code>, <code>/www/doc/sql</code>, etc. have been moved inside the ACS core
package (<code>/packages/acs-core</code>).

<p>The package manager UI can be accessed at
<a href="/admin/apm/">http://<i>yourservername.com</i>/admin/apm/</a>
(site-wide administrators only).

<h3><a name=startup>ACS Startup (Bootstrapping)</a></h3>

When AOLserver starts up, the first thing it does is to source every <code>.tcl</code>
file in the <code>/tcl</code> directory. This still occurs, but very importantly, the
<code>0-acs-init.tcl</code> script is sourced first. The entire startup process
(discussed in detail in the <i><a href="core-arch-guide/bootstrap">Bootstrapping</a></i>) is:

<ul>
<li>AOLserver sources <code>/tcl/0-acs-init.tcl</code>.
<li><code>0-acs-init.tcl</code> sources <code>/packages/acs-core/bootstrap.tcl</code>.
<li><code>bootstrap.tcl</code> sources all <code>*-procs.tcl</code> files in the <code>acs-core</code>
package.
<li><code>bootstrap.tcl</code> scan all directories inside the <code>/packages</code> directory,
looking for package specification files (<code>*.info</code> files) which describe packages.
If it finds any new ones, it loads them into the database.
<li><code>bootstrap.tcl</code> sources the <code>*-procs.tcl</code> files for all enabled packages.
<li><code>bootstrap.tcl</code> sources the <code>*-init.tcl</code> files for all enabled packages.
<li>AOLserver continues to source files in the <code>/tcl</code> directory (i.e., every file
after <code>0-acs-init.tcl</code> in lexicographical order).
</ul>

This more complicated process is necessary to support packages. The distinction between
<code>*-procs.tcl</code> and <code>*-init.tcl</code> files is necessary to

<ul>
<li>prevent ordering
conflicts between packages, where the initialization code for package A requires a procedure
in package B which hasn't been defined yet (since B succeeds A in lexicographical order).
<li>make it possible to implement a package manager feature similar to AOLserver 2's
<i>Reload Client Tcl</i>.
This requires a distinction between procedures to reload (<code>*-procs.tcl</code>) and
initialization code that should truly be called only once (<code>*-init.tcl</code>).
</ul>

<h3><a name="request-processor">Request Processor</a></h3>

<h4>Pre-3.3</h4>

In versions of ACS before 3.2, it's very difficult to determine exactly which
code is running when a particular request is executed. In general, all kinds of filters
are executed, and then some registered procedure (maybe the abstract URL handler)
is invoked (or, if abstract URLs are disabled, a file is served directly). There
are several problems with this approach, most notably that:

<ol>
<li>It's difficult to deliver files which don't physically live underneath the page
root (in the <code>/www</code> directory), as in the case of pages associated with
packages.
<li>It's very difficult to control the order in which filters are executed.
<li>It's difficult to determine which code is executed for requests to which URLs.
<li>If something breaks, it's very difficult to determine which filter is causing the problem.
<li>Scoped requests need to be handled specially, with <code>ns_register_proc</code>s for each
possible URL prefix (<code>/groups</code>, <code>/<i>some-group-type</i></code>,
<code>/<i>some-group-name</i></code>, etc.).
<li>Filters and registered procedures are strictly URL-based, so they break under
scoping (e.g., a procedure registered for <code>/download/files/</code> won't work for requests
under <code>/groups/<i>some-group-name</i>/download/files/62/smug.jpg</code>).
</ol>

<h4>In 3.3 and Beyond</h4>

In ACS version 3.3, absolutely every request is served through a unified
request processor
(<code>rpp_handler</code> in <code>/packages/acs-core/request-processor-procs.tcl</code>), described
in detail in the <a href="core-arch-guide/request-processor">request processor documentation</a>.

We have replacement routines for <code>ns_register_filter</code> and
<code>ns_register_proc</code>, called <code>ad_register_filter</code> and
<code>ad_register_proc</code> respectively, which solve the first four problems:

<ol>
<li>The request processor is smart enough to look inside packages to deliver files in their
<code>www</code> and <code>admin-www</code> directories.
<li><code>ad_register_filter</code> has a <code>-priority</code> flag. Filters with numerically lower
priorities run before filters with numerically higher priorities.
<li>There are nifty monitoring tools under
<a href="/admin/monitoring/">http://<i>yourservername.com</i>/admin/monitoring/</a>
which let you determine which filters and procs are executed when a particular
URL is requested.
<li>Procedures registered with the new API provide full stack traces in the log when something
goes wrong.
</ol>

<p>We'll solve the latter two problems as soon as subcommunities are implemented for 4.0.

<blockquote>
<b>Important: You <i>must</i> use <code>ad_register_filter</code> and <code>ad_register_proc</code>
rather than the corresponding <code>ns_</code> calls.</b> <code>ns_register_filter</code>
and <code>ns_register_proc</code> are disabled in the release version of ACS 3.3.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name=database>Database Access API</a></h3>

Usage of <code>ns_db</code> is being phased out (although we're not deprecating <code>ns_db</code> yet
- you can continue to use it).
That's right, we're providing a new Database Access API
which totally frees you from the responsibility of allocating database handles and passing
them around to subroutines. For instance, instead of

<blockquote><pre>
set selection [ns_db select $db "select foo, bar from greeble"]
while { [ns_db getrow $db $selection] } {
    set_variables_after_query
    append output "&lt;li>foo=$foo; bar=$bar\n"
}
ns_db releasehandle</pre></blockquote>

you can now just write

<blockquote><pre>db_foreach "select foo, bar from greeble" {
    append output "&lt;li>foo=$foo; bar=$bar\n"
}
db_release_unused_handles</pre></blockquote>

Not a database handle (<code>$db</code>) in sight; the database handles are managed and
recycled for you. Don't worry, <i>this actually does work</i> (despite the many incredulous
emails we've received): the entire package manager was written with it and works without
a hitch.

<p>See the <a href="core-arch-guide/database-access-api">Database Access API
documentation</a> for more information, including a discussion of why
this is A Good Idea<font size=1><sup>TM</sup></font>.

<h3><a name=documents>Document API</a></h3>

Fare thee well, <code>ReturnHeaders</code>, <code>ns_write</code>, <code>ns_return</code>, and friends!
From <a href="documents"><i>Building Documents in ACS</i></a> (philg, jsalz):

<blockquote>
Standard AOLserver programming, like CGI scripting before it, had the
programmer directly writing bytes to a client browser connection.  Thus
from 1995 through 2000 an AOLserver programmer would build up a complete
HTML page in a script and write the bytes of that page to the client
either all at once with <code>ns_return</code> or incrementally with
<code>ns_write</code>.

<p>

Problems with this standard old approach:

<ul>
<li>difficult to control style on a site-global basis via a master
template 

<li>difficult to write a script that returns an XML document that is
then rendered by a higher-level request processor (i.e., each individual
script has to be aware of all possible document types that might be
required by client, e.g., HTML, WML, XML, etc.)

<li>easy for novice programmer to create server performance problems by
calling API procedures that block in the TCP stack while holding a
database handle from the pool (i.e., a script could be waiting for a
client on a slow modem to accept some packets while holding a database
connection from a limited pool)

</ul>
</blockquote>

The basic idea is that, in Tcl scripts, you now use <code>doc_set_property</code> to set the
title and navigational context for a document, and <code>doc_body_append</code>
(rather than <code>ns_write</code>) to build up the body for the page (leaving out the
headers and footers) master template later builds a page for you, tacking on header,
title, navbar, footer, etc. as appropriate in a customizable way.

<p>Don't worry, you don't need to start using this right away.
