<h3>The Big Idea</h3>

We want a standard way of documenting a site for end-users.  We need

<ul>

<li>documentation for the whole site that gives a new user or
administrator a high-level perspective of system capabilities

<li>documentation of individual pages 

<li>documentation of words or phrases 

</ul>

We want to achieve the following technical objectives:

<ul>

<li>we only have to change documentation style (e.g., background color,
font design) in one place

<li>a single documentation file can be authored in such a way that users
with different levels of privilege or service will see only the relevant
portion

<li>documentation authors can continue to use familiar tools, e.g.,
tools that are optimized for authoring HTML (perhaps with a few extra
tags) 

</ul>

<h3>The Medium-sized Idea</h3>

The high level documentation is in traditionally authored directories of
HTML files, but we augment HTML with a set of additional tags to enforce
site-wide style conventions (these will be a superset of the site-wide
style tags used by online pages, as described in <a
href="/doc/style">/doc/style</a>).  The augmentation also provides for tags
that will switch on a section only if a user has selected a particular
feature (for example, in a documentation production site, only users
whose companies have elected "fancy workflow authorization" will see
sections related to that).  Sometimes we augment HTML in order to
provide greater convenience for the documentation authors, for example,
we provide by default a <code>glossterm</code> tag that saves a doc author from
having to hard-code in a link to the ACS glossary module: 
<code>/glossary/one?term=film</code>.

<p>

The page-level documentation is stored in conventionally named files
underneath the Web server root.  Support is provided for multi-lingual
documentation.

<p>

The standard ACS /glossary module is used to provide word and phrase
definitions.

<h3>Under the hood</h3>

We use ADP pages to create all documentation.  This allows us to register
special tags using <code>ns_register_adptag</code>.  These special
tags help enforce site-wide style conventions as well as providing a
mechanism that will act as a switch for a particular section.  For
instance, the code run by the special tag may check whether or not the
user is a member of a particular user group.  If the user is in the
group, then the procedure returns the string between the tags with the
appropriate font and formating.  If the user is not in the group, then
the procedure returns the empty string.

<p>

We place a call to <code>help_link</code> on every page that could
potentially have a help file.  This procedure determines whether or
not there actually is a help file associated with the given file.  If
a help file exists, <code>help_link</code> returns a string containing
a link to a page that will serve the requested help file.  If no help
file exists then the empty string is returned.

<p>

We name all page-level help files with the same filename as the page
that they document, with a .help extension.  For instance, if we have
a URL named foo, the help file will be named foo.help.  If a
multi-lingual help system is in place then the help file in english
will be foo.en.help (the help file in french will be foo.fr.help,
etc.).  Language encoding and the sorting out of user preferences are
as described in <a href="/doc/style">/doc/style</a>.

<p>

These help files reside in a directory hierarchy mirroring that of the
files that they document, rooted at a location specified by the
HelpPageRoot parameter in the ns/server/servername/acs/help section of
the server's auxiliary .ini file. This parameter specifies the root of
the help file's directory hierarchy as a relative path from the server's
page root, so HelpPageRoot=/help would specify that all help files lived
under /web/servername/www/help. Leaving it blank specifies that the help
page root is the same as the server's page root, so .help files reside
in the same directories as their corresponding  files.

<p>

.help files are registered to be interpreted as ADP files so that they
can be viewed directly, in order to aid in their development.

<h3>If you really love our ideas...</h3>

If you really really love the photo.net/ACS style then you'll have kept
the Yahoo-style context/navigation bars above the top HR in most of your
scripts.  It seems to us that a natural companion to this is a help link
just underneath the HR and to the far right of the page.  As long as
we've got that, we might as well also include other options that are
sort of outside the normal realm and flow of what a user might be doing
with the page.  For example, an "administer" link could go there.

<p>

To faciliate this style of programming, we've defined
<code>help_upper_right_menu</code> which takes an arbitrary number of
optional args, each of which is a list of URL and anchor (similar to the
<code>ad_context_bar</code> args).  These are extra options on the menu
and they will be displayed in the order supplied, followed by a help
link (if the .help file is found in the file system).



<h3>The Steps</h3>

<ul>

<li>decide whether you want to go multi-lingual or not.

<li>decide what types of things you would like to standardize.  Examples
could be setting a specific, easily changable font or linking glossary terms
to their definitions.

<li>define a special tag for each type of item that should be standardized.

<li>define a special tag for each type of content switch you would like
to have (for instance, if you only want to show the workflow section to
specific companies, you can wrap the workflow section in a
<code>&lt;workflow&gt;</code> tag).

<li>insert calls to <code>help_link</code> in your  scripts and .adp
templates

</ul>
