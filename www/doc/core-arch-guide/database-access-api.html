<h3><font color=red>Backward Incompatibility Alert</font></h3>

<em>
As of ACS 3.4, all <code>db_*</code> calls that accept a SQL/DML/DDL
statement as an argument now require a statement name to be provided
as the first argument. See <a href=#sql_abstraction>SQL
Abstraction</a> below for details.
</em>

<li>Tcl procedures: /packages/acs-core/10-database-procs.tcl
</ul>

<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

One of ACS's great strengths is that code written for it is very close
to the database. It is very easy to interact with the database from
anywhere within ACS. Our goal is to develop a coherent API for
database access which makes this even easier.

<p>

There were four significant problems with the way ACS previously used
the database (i.e., directly through the <code>ns_db</code>
interface):

<ol>

<li><b>Handle management</b>. We required code to pass database
handles around, and for routines which needed to perform database
access but didn't receive a database handle as input, it was difficult
to know from which of the three "magic pools" (main, subquery, and
log) to allocate a new handle.

<p>

<li><b>Nested transactions</b>. In our Oracle driver, <code>begin
transaction</code> really means "turn auto-commit mode off" and
<code>end transaction</code> means "commit the current transaction and
turn auto-commit mode on." Thus if transactional code needed to call
a routine which needed to operate transactionally, the semantics were
non-obvious. Consider:

<blockquote><pre>proc foo { db args } {
    db_transaction {
      ...
    }
}

db_transaction {
    db_dml unused "insert into greeble(bork) values(33)"
    foo $db
    db_dml unused "insert into greeble(bork) values(50)"
}</pre></blockquote>

This would insert greeble #33 and do all the stuff in <code>foo</code>
transactionally, but the <code>end transaction</code> in
<code>foo</code> would actually cause a commit, and greeble #50 would
later be inserted in auto-commit mode.  This could cause subtle bugs:
e.g., in the case that the insert for greeble #50 failed, part of the
"transaction" would have already have been committed!.  This is not a
good thing.

<p>

<li><b>Unorthodox use of variables</b>. The standard mechanism for
mapping column values into variables involved the use of the
<code>set_variables_after_query</code> routine, which relies on an
uplevel variable named <code>selection</code> (likewise for
<code>set_variables_after_subquery</code> and
<code>subselection</code>).

<p>

<li><b>Hard-coded reliance on Oracle</b>. It's difficult to write code
supporting various different databases (dynamically using the
appropriate dialect based on the type of database being used, e.g.,
using <code>DECODE</code> on Oracle and <code>CASE ... WHEN</code> on
Postgres).

</ol>

The Database Access API addresses the first three problems by:

<ol>
<li>making use of database handles transparent

<li>wrapping common database operations (including transaction
management) in Tcl control structures (this is, after all, what Tcl is
good at!)
</ol>

It lays the groundwork for addressing the fourth problem by assigning
each SQL statement a logical name. In a future version of the ACS
Core, this API will translate logical statement names into actual SQL,
based on the type of database in use. (To smooth the learning curve,
we provide a facility for writing SQL inline for a "default SQL
dialect", which we assume to be Oracle for now.)

<p>

To be clear, SQL abstraction is <em>not</em> fully implemented in ACS
3.4. The statement names supplied to each call are not used by the
API at all. The API's design for SQL abstraction is in fact
incomplete; unresolved issues include:

<ul>

<li>how to add <code>WHERE</code> clause criteria dynamically

<li>how to build a dynamic <code>ORDER BY</code> clause (Ben Adida has
a proposed solution for this)

<li>how to define a statement's formal interface (i.e., what bind
variables it expects, what columns its <code>SELECT</code> clause must
contain if it's a query) without actually implementing the statement
in a specific SQL dialect

</ul>

So why is the incremental change of adding statement naming to the API
worth the effort? It is worth the effort because we know that giving
each SQL statement a logical name will be required by the complete SQL
abstraction design. Therefore, we know that the effort will not be
wasted, and taking advantage of the new support for bind variables
will already require code that uses 3.3.0 version of the API to be
updated.

<h3>The Bell Tolls for <code>set_variables_after_query</code></h3>

<code>set_variables_after_query</code> is gone! (Well, it's still there, but you'll never
need to use it.) The new API routines set local variables automatically. For instance:

<blockquote><pre>db_1row select_names "select first_names, last_name from users where user_id = [ad_get_user_id]"
doc_body_append "Hello, $first_names $last_name!"</pre></blockquote>

Like <code>ns_db 1row</code>, this will bomb if the query doesn't return any rows (no such
user exists). If this isn't what you want, you can write:

<blockquote><pre>if { [db_0or1row select_names "select first_names, last_name from users where user_id = [ad_get_user_id]"] } {
    doc_body_append "Hello, $first_names $last_name!"
} else {
    # Executed if the query returns no rows.
    doc_body_append "There's no such user!"
}</pre></blockquote>

Selecting a bunch of rows is a lot prettier now:

<blockquote><pre>db_foreach select_names "select first_names, last_name from users" {
     doc_body_append "Say hi to $first_names $last_name for me!&lt;br&gt;"
}</pre></blockquote>

That's right, <code>db_foreach</code> is now like <code>ns_db select</code> plus
a <code>while</code> loop plus <code>set_variables_after_query</code> plus
an <code>if</code> statement (containing code to be
executed if no rows are returned).

<blockquote><pre>db_foreach select_names "select first_names, last_name from users where last_name like 'S%'" {
     doc_body_append "Say hi to $first_names $last_name for me!&lt;br&gt;"
} if_no_rows {
     doc_body_append "There aren't any users with last names beginnings with S!"
}</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Handle Management</h3>

The new API keeps track of which handles are in use, and automatically
allocates new handles when they are necessary (e.g., to perform
subqueries while a select is active). For example:

<blockquote><pre>doc_body_append "&lt;ul&gt;"
db_foreach select_names "select first_names, last_name, user_id from users" {
    # Automatically allocated a database handle from the main pool.
    doc_body_append "&lt;li&gt;User $first_names $last_name\n&lt;ul&gt;"

    db_foreach select_groups "select group_id from user_group_map where user_id = $user_id" {
        # There's a selection in progress, so we allocated a database handle
        # from the subquery pool for this selection.
        doc_body_append "&lt;li&gt;Member of group #$group_id.\n"
    } if_no_rows {
        # Not a member of any groups.
        doc_body_append "&lt;li&gt;Not a member of any group.\n"
    }
}
doc_body_append "&lt;/ul&gt;"
db_release_unused_handles</pre></blockquote>

A new handle isn't actually allocated and released for every selection, of course -
as a performance optimization, the API keeps old handles around until <code>db_release_unused_handles</code>
is invoked (or the script terminates).

<p>Note that there is no analogue to <code>ns_db gethandle</code> - the handle
is always automatically allocated the first time it's needed.

<h3>Bind Variables</h3>

We often write queries and DML like:

<blockquote><pre>
db_dml presentation_delete "delete from wp_presentations where presentation_id = $presentation_id"
</pre></blockquote>

But what if <code>$presentation_id</code> isn't an integer - it's something
like <code>"3 or 1 = 1"</code>, yielding a query like

<blockquote><pre>
delete from wp_presentations where presentation_id = 3 or 1 = 1
</pre></blockquote>

which deletes every presentation in the database? We can get around this by
carefully checking every string included in a SQL query, but a safer way
is to use <b>bind variables</b>. This enables the following syntax:

<blockquote><pre>
db_dml presentation_delete "
    delete from wp_presentations where presentation_id = :presentation_id
"
</pre></blockquote>

The value for <code>presentation_id</code> is pulled from the Tcl variable
<code>$presentation_id</code> (in the current stack frame), so even if input checking is spotty and
<code>$presentation_id</code> is set to <code>3 or 1 = 1</code> as above,
Oracle will attempt to delete presentations whose presentation ID is literally
<code>'3 or 1 = 1'</code> (i.e., no presentations, since <code>'3 or 1 = 1'</code>
can't possibly be a valid integer primary key for <code>wp_presentations</code>.
In general, since Oracle always considers the values of bind variables to be
literals, it becomes more difficult for users to perform URL surgery to trick
scripts into running dangerous queries and DML.

<p>Every <code>db_*</code> command accepting a
SQL command as an argument now supports bind variables. You can either

<ul>
<li>specify the <code>-bind</code> switch to provide a set with bind variable values, or
<li>specify the <code>-bind</code> switch to explicitly provide a list of bind variable names and
values, or
<li>not specify a bind variable list at all, in which case Tcl variables are
used as bind variables.
</ul>

The default behavior (i.e., if the <code>-bind</code> switch is omitted)
is that these procedures expect to find local
variables that correspond in name to the referenced bind variables,
e.g.:

<blockquote><pre>
set user_id 123456
set role "administrator"

db_foreach user_group_memberships_by_role {
    select g.group_id, g.group_name
    from user_groups g, user_group_map map
    where g.group_id = map.user_id
    and map.user_id = :user_id
    and map.role = :role
} {
    # do something for each group of which user 123456 is in the role
    # of "administrator"
}
</pre></blockquote>

The value of the local Tcl variable <code>user_id</code> (123456) is
bound to the <code>user_id</code> bind variable.

<p>

The <code>-bind</code> switch can takes the name of an <code>ns_set</code>
containing keys for each bind variable named in the query, e.g.:

<blockquote><pre>
set bind_vars [ns_set create]
ns_set put $bind_vars user_id 123456
ns_set put $bind_vars role "administrator"

db_foreach user_group_memberships_by_role {
    select g.group_id, g.group_name
    from user_groups g, user_group_map map
    where g.group_id = map.user_id
    and map.user_id = :user_id
    and map.role = :role
} -bind $bind_vars {
    # do something for each group in which user 123456 has the role
    # of "administrator"
}
</pre></blockquote>

Alternatively, as an argument to <code>-bind</code> you can specify a list
of alternating name/value pairs for bind variables:

<blockquote><pre>
db_foreach user_group_memberships_by_role {
    select g.group_id, g.group_name
    from user_groups g, user_group_map map
    where g.group_id = map.user_id
    and map.user_id = :user_id
    and map.role = :role
} -bind [list user_id 123456 role "administrator"] {
    # do something for each group in which user 123456 has the role
    # of "administrator"
}
</pre></blockquote>

<h3><a name=sql_abstraction>SQL Abstraction</a></h3>

We now require that each SQL statement be assigned a logical name for
the statement that is unique to the procedure or page in which it is
defined. This is so that (eventually) we can implement logically named
statements with alternative SQL for non-Oracle databases (e.g.,
Postgres). More on this later.

<h3><a name=null>Nulls and Bind Variables</a></h3>

<dd>When processing a DML statement, Oracle coerces empty strings into
<code>null</code>. (This coercion does <em>not</em> occur in the
<code>WHERE</code> clause of a query, i.e.
<code>col&nbsp;=&nbsp;''</code> and <code>col&nbsp;is&nbsp;null</code>
are not equivalent.)

<p>

As a result, when using bind variables, the only way to make Oracle
set a column value to <code>null</code> is to set the corresponding
bind variable to the empty string, since a bind variable whose value
is the string "null" will be interpreted as the literal string "null".

<p>

These Oracle quirks complicate the process of writing clear and
abstract DML difficult. Here is an example that illustrates why:

<blockquote><pre>
#
# Given the table:
#
#   create table foo (
#           bar        integer,
#           baz        varchar(10)
#   );
#

set bar ""
set baz ""

db_dml foo_create "insert into foo(bar, baz) values(:bar, :baz)"
#
# the values of the "bar" and "baz" columns in the new row are both
# null, because Oracle has coerced the empty string (even for the
# numeric column "bar") into null in both cases
</pre></blockquote>

Since databases other than Oracle do not coerce empty strings into
<code>null</code>, this code has different semantics depending on the
underlying database (i.e., the row that gets inserted may not have
null as its column values), which defeats the purpose of SQL
abstraction.

<p>

Therefore, the Database Access API provides a database-independent way
to represent <code>null</code> (instead of the Oracle-specific idiom
of the empty string): <strong><code>db_null</code></strong>.

<p>

Use it instead of the empty string whenever you want to set a column
value explicitly to <code>null</code>, e.g.:

<blockquote><pre>
set bar [db_null]
set baz [db_null]

db_dml foo_create "insert into foo(bar, baz) values(:bar, :baz)"
#
# sets the values for both the "bar" and "baz" columns to null
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

<h3>Placing Column Values in Arrays and Sets</h3>

Normally, <code>db_foreach</code>, <code>db_0or1row</code>, and <code>db_1row</code>
places the results of queries in Tcl variables, so you can say:

<blockquote><pre>
db_foreach users_select "select first_names, last_name from users" {
    doc_body_append "&lt;li>$first_names $last_name\n"
}
</pre></blockquote>

However, sometimes this is not sufficient: you may need to examine the rows returned,
to dynamically determine the set of columns returned by the query, or to avoid collisions
with existing variables. You can use the <code>-column_array</code> and
<code>-column_set</code> switches to 
<code>db_foreach</code>, <code>db_0or1row</code>, and <code>db_1row</code>
to instruct the database routines to place the results in a Tcl array or <code>ns_set</code>,
respectively, where the keys are the column names and the values are the column values.
For example:

<blockquote><pre>
db_foreach users_select "select first_names, last_name from users" -column_set columns {
    # Now $columns is an ns_set.
    doc_body_append "&lt;li>"
    for { set i 0 } { $i &lt; [ns_set size $columns] } { incr i } {
        doc_body_append "[ns_set key $columns $i] is [ns_set value $columns $i]. \n"
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>

will write something like:

<ul>
<li>first_names is Jon. last_name is Salz.
<li>first_names is Lars. last_name is Pind.
<li>first_names is Michael. last_name is Yoon.
</ul>

<h3>API</h3>

Note that you never have to use <code>ns_db</code> anymore (including
<code>ns_db gethandle</code>)! Just start doing stuff, and (if you
want) call <code>db_release_unused_handles</code> when you're done as
a hint to release the database handle.

<p>

<dt><code><strong>db_null</strong></code>

<dd>Returns a value which can be used in a bind variable to represent
the SQL value <code>null</code>. See <a href="#null">Nulls and Bind Variables</a>
above.

<dt><code><b>db_release_unused_handles</b></code>

<dd>
Releases any allocated, unused database handles.

<p>

<dt><code><strong>db_transaction</strong> <em>transaction_code</em> [
    on_error <em>error_code</em> ]</code>

<dd>
 Executes <code>transaction_code</code> with transactional semantics.  This means that either all of the database commands
    within <code>transaction_code</code> are committed to the database or none of them are.  Nested transactions are supported 
    (end transaction is transparently ns_db dml'ed when the outermost transaction completes).<p>

    To handle errors, use <code>db_transaction {transaction_code} on_error {error_code}</code>.  Any error generated in 
    <code>transaction_code</code> will be caught automatically and process control will transfer to <code>error_code</code>
    with a variable <code>errmsg</code> set.  The error_code block can then clean up after the error, such as presenting a usable
    error message to the user.  Following the execution of <code>error_code</code> the transaction will be aborted.
    Alternatively, a command to continue the transaction <code>db_continue_transaction</code> can be issued.  This
    command will commit any successful database commands when the transaction completes, assuming no further errors are raised.  
    If you want to explicity abort the transaction, call <code>db_abort_transaction</code>
    from within the <code>transaction_code</code> block or the <code>error_code</code> block.<p>

    Example 1:<br>
    In this example, db_dml triggers an error, so control passes to the on_error block which prints a readable error.
    <blockquote><pre>
    db_transaction {
	db_dml test "nonsense"
    } on_error {
	ad_return_complaint "The DML failed."
    }
    </pre></blockquote>

    Example 2:<br>
    In this example, the second command, "nonsense" triggers an error.  There is no on_error block, so the
    transaction is immediately halted and aborted.
    <blockquote><pre>
    db_transaction {
	db_dml test {insert into footest values(1)}
	nonsense
	db_dml test {insert into footest values(2)}
    } 
    </pre></blockquote>

    Example 3:<br>
    In this example, all of the dml statements are executed and committed.  The call to db_abort_transaction
    signals that the transaction should be aborted which activates the higher level on_error block.  That code
    issues a db_continue_transaction which commits the transaction.  Had there not been an on_error block, none
    of the dml statements would have been committed.
    <blockquote><pre>
    db_transaction {
	db_dml test {insert into footest values(1)}
	db_transaction {
	    db_dml test {insert into footest values(2) }
	    db_abort_transaction
	}
	db_dml test {insert into footest values(3) }
    } on_error {
	db_continue_transaction
    }
    </pre></blockquote>

Example 4:

<blockquote><pre>proc replace_the_foo { col } {
    db_transaction {
        db_dml "delete from foo"
        db_dml "insert into foo(col) values($col)"
    }
}

proc print_the_foo {} {
    doc_body_append "foo is [db_string "select col from foo"]&lt;br&gt;\n"
}

replace_the_foo 8
print_the_foo ; # Writes out "foo is 8"

db_transaction {
    replace_the_foo 14
    print_the_foo ; # Writes out "foo is 14"
    db_dml "insert into some_other_table(col) values(999)"
    ...
    db_abort_transaction
}

print_the_foo ; # Writes out "foo is 8"</pre></blockquote>
<p>

<dt><code><b>db_abort_transaction</b></code>

<dd>
Aborts all levels of a transaction.  That is if this is called within
    several nested transactions, all of them are terminated.  Use
    this insetead of <code>db_dml "abort" "abort transaction"</code>.
<p>

<dt><code><b>db_continue_transaction</b></code>

<dd>
    If a transaction is set to be aborted, this procedure allows it to 
    continue.  Intended for use within a <code>db_transaction</code>
    on_error code block only.
<p>    
    
    
<dt><code><b>db_resultrows</b></code>
<dd>Returns the number of rows affected or inserted by the previous DML statement.

<p>

<dt><code><b>db_with_handle</b> <i>var</i> <i>code_block</i></code>
<dd>Places a database handle into the variable <code><i>var</i></code> and executes <code><i>code_block</i></code>.
This is useful when you don't want to have to use the new API
(<code>db_foreach</code>, <code>db_1row</code>, etc.), but
need to use database handles explicitly.

<p>Example:

<blockquote><pre>proc lookup_the_foo { foo } {
    db_with_handle db {
        return [database_to_tcl_string $db "select ..."]
    }
}

db_with_handle db {
    # Now there's a database handle in $db.
    set selection [ns_db select $db "select foo from bar"]
    while { [ns_db getrow $db $selection] } {
        set_variables_after_query

        lookup_the_foo $foo
    }
}</pre></blockquote>

<dt><code><b>db_nullify_empty_string</b> <em>string</em></code>

<dd>For true SQL purists, we provide the convenience function
<strong><code>db_nullify_empty_string</code></strong>, which returns
[db_null] if its <code><em>string</em></code> argument is the empty
string and can be used to encapsulate another Oracle quirk:

<blockquote><pre>
set baz ""

# Clean out the foo table
#
db_dml unused "delete from foo"

db_dml unused "insert into foo(baz) values('$baz')"

set n_rows [db_string unused "select count(*) from foo where baz is null"]
#
# $n_rows is 1; in effect, the "baz is null" criterion is matching
# the empty string we just inserted (because of Oracle's coercion
# quirk)
</pre></blockquote>

To balance out this asymmetry, you can explicitly set <code>baz</code>
to <code>null</code> by writing:

<blockquote><pre>
db_dml foo_insert "insert into foo(baz) values(:1)" {[db_nullify_empty_string $baz]}
</pre></blockquote>

</dl>

<h4>Implementation Design (work in progress)</h4>

<em>The ideas here are preliminary, so please send feedback to <a
href="mailto:michael@arsdigita.com">michael@arsdigita.com</a>. There
may well be a much simpler, superior design that I (Michael) am just
missing right now. If so, please let me know!</em>

<p>

The basic idea is to translate the logical
<code><em>statement-name</em></code> into an actual SQL statement, written
in the appropriate SQL dialect for the RDBMS that is in use. The
<code><em>sql</em></code> argument is essentially a convenience that
enables the SQL for the "default dialect" to be written inline. For
3.4, we will probably use configuration parameters to tell the
Database Access API what the default dialect is and what dialect is
actually in use:

<blockquote><pre>
[ns/server/<em>server_name</em>/acs]
...
DefaultSQLDialect=oracle8
SQLDialect=postgres7
</pre></blockquote>

(An alternative approach would be to use the ACS Package Manager,
i.e., install a "pseudo-package" with no actual code to indicate what
RDBMS is installed. Then, the Database Access API could query the APM
to figure what SQL dialect to employ.)

<p>

For instructing the Database Access API to translate a named statement
in a specific SQL dialect, we may define a new API call:

<blockquote><pre>
db_implement_statement <em>statement_location</em> <em>statement_name</em> <em>sql_dialect</em> <em>sql</em>
</pre></blockquote>

which would be called at server initialization time. The Database
Access API will then know to use the SQL statement appropriate for the
specified <code>SQLDialect</code>. (The name
<code>db_implement_statement</code> is very tentative.)

<p>

Issues:

<ul>

<li>Is making the caller of <code>db_implement_statement</code> explicitly
specify the statement location (e.g., "/bboard/q-and-a") too much of a
pain? Can we make this more convenient somehow?

<p>

<li>In the case that the inline SQL is not in the specified
<code>SQLDialect</code>, reading the rewritten SQL into memory for the
life of the server may not be a good idea. The three basic approaches
I can think of to implement the <code>db_implement_statement</code>
API are:

<ol>
<li>Cache the rewritten SQL for the appropriate SQL dialect in an
<code>nsv</code> array

<li>Cache the rewritten SQL for the appropriate SQL dialect in a
special database table that we keep pinned in memory

<li>Cache the rewritten SQL for the appropriate SQL dialect in a
special file, maybe even a DBM file
</ol>

<p>

<li>Given the above two issues, should we rethink the
<code>db_implement_statement</code> API altogether?

<p>

One possibility is a file-based approach, where the alternative SQL
statements would live in conventionally named and located files, e.g.,
<code>/bboard/q-and-a.postgres7</code> would contain Postgres 7
versions of the SQL statements in <code>/bboard/q-and-a.tcl</code>.)
A potential con of this approach is that the Database Access API would
have to perform file I/O for every SQL statement that's been
rewritten. This may be a non-issue; I don't actually know. (We could
augment this approach with caching too, perhaps a fixed-size LRU
cache.)

<p>

Another similar approach would be just to have one massive, magic file for
each SQL dialect that maps each statement identifier (location plus
name) to the corresponding statement.

<p>

<li>Another larger problem is the fact that this design does not work
for instances where we build a SQL statement based on control flow
logic, e.g., we sometimes join in an extra table based on the user
input. This problem doesn't mean that the design as a whole is broken;
it just means that this design alone does not get us all the way to
full SQL abstraction.

</ul>

Version 2.1 of <a
href="http://www.arsdigita.com/free-tools/oracle-driver">the ArsDigita
Oracle Driver</a> adds a set of <code>ns_ora</code> analogs for the
following <code>ns_db</code> calls: <code>0or1row</code>,
<code>1row</code>, <code>select</code>, and <code>dml</code>. (It also
adds <code>ns_ora array_dml</code>.) Thus, the groundwork for
implementing the above API for ACS/Oracle is already established.

<p>

We plan to defer to the OpenACS team for the Postgres implementation
of the API.
