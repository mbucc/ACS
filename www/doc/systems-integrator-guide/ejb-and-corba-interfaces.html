<h3>Introduction: Why Remote Procedure Call Interfaces?</h3>

The ArsDigita Community System already provides two interfaces: a web
interface (HTML over HTTP), and a database schema.  Why would you want
a remote procedure call interface, either CORBA or EJB?  Using a web
interface programmatically is difficult because web interfaces are
designed for humans.  Using the database directly is difficult because
you must install Oracle client software wherever you wish to run your
client.  Also, ...

<p>

&lt;<em>More introductory information here, e.g., the distinction
between ACS acting as a CORBA/EJB server and ACS acting as a CORBA/EJB
client</em>&gt;

<h3>Client Scenarios</h3>

The following scenarios describe how you might take advantage of the EJB
interface for various purposes. The CORBA interface provides the same
features.

<h3>Scenario: ACS User Management</h3>

You are adding an ACS to your network and you want to load it up with
users from your other systems.  First, you'll want to look up a user by
name or e-mail address to see if he already has an ACS user id:

<blockquote><pre>
// First try his e-mail address.
UserRecord acs_user = <b>acs_user_home.get_user_by_email(
    "mayoff@arsdigita.com")</b>;

if (acs_user == null) {
    // Not found; try his name.
    acs_user = <b>acs_user_home.get_user_by_name("Rob",
	"Mayoff")</b>;
}

if (acs_user != null) {
    // Found him.
    System.out.println("Rob Mayoff has user_id "
	+ acs_user.user_id);
}
</pre></blockquote>

If you could not find the user, then you'll want to create him:

<blockquote><pre>
if (acs_user == null) {
    acs_user = new UserRecord();
    acs_user.first_names = "Rob";
    acs_user.last_name = "Mayoff";
    acs_user.email = "mayoff@arsdigita.com";
    acs_user.password = "dqd";
    acs_user = <b>acs_user_home.create_user(acs_user)</b>;
    System.out.println("Rob Mayoff has user_id "
	+ acs_user.user_id);
}
</pre></blockquote>

Later on, when you want to come back to the user, you can access him by
ACS user id:

<blockquote><pre>
UserRecord acs_user = <b>acs_user_home.get_user_by_id(123)</b>;
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Scenario: Ticket Summary</h3>

You use the ACS ticket tracker as part of your customer support
operation and you want to produce a report that includes statistics
about tickets.

<p>

...

<h3>Scenario: Authorization</h3>

You want to use the ACS permissions system to control the actions of
users on another system.

<h3>Notes from 2000-6-5 Conference</h3>
<ul>

	<li>Higher-level: what does the interface let you do?
	<li>Discuss performance: describe how to use our system, and how to
	move to a higher-performance configuration

	<p>
	Interfaces:

	<li>register a new user, get user_id back
	<li>submit ticket:
	<li>what projects are available in the ticket tracker, and what
		subprojects?

	<p>
	<li>search for user by last name, e-mail address, etc.
	<li>look for ad_permission_p type functions in PL/SQL
	<li>describe scenarios: e.g. web application talking to a remote ACS

	<p>
	<li>Divide into different IDL modules for different parts of ACS
	<li>See about getting package manager to automatically install
	EJB/CORBA interfaces

</ul>

<h3>Package Names</h3>

The Java interfaces for the ACS/CORBA interface are in the Java package
<code>com.arsdigita.CORBA.ACS</code>. The Java interfaces for the
ACS/EJB interface are in <code>com.arsdigita.EJB.ACS</code>.

<p> We can't just use <code>com.arsdigita.ACS</code> for both, because
we might reasonably want a <code>User</code> class in each interface,
but the class must be defined differently under the two frameworks.

<h3>Object References</h3>

Although the CORBA and EJB specifications support object-based designs,
Oracle's implementations (as of 8.1.6) are somewhat deficient. Oracle
lacks the ability to create persistent object references (in either
framework) that span client and server lifetimes. This means that once
a client has obtained a reference to some remote Oracle object, it has
no way of saving that reference such that some possibly different client
can use it at an arbitrary time in the future to access the remote
object.

<p> Concretely, here's what you'd like:

<ul>
	<li>The client looks up the <code>/acs</code> object in the
	registered object directory.
	<li>The client calls <code>ad = acs.get_most_recent_ad(some_user_id)</code>
	and gets back a reference to a ClassifiedAd.
	<li>The client calls <code>sor = orb.object_to_string(ad)</code>, and writes
	this stringified object reference to a file.
	<li>The client exits.
	<li>Time passes.
	<li>The client runs again.
	<li>The client reads the object reference from the file and calls
	<code>ad = orb.string_to_object(sor)</code> on it.
	<li>The client calls <code>one_line = ad.get_one_line()</code> to get
	the one-line description of the ad.  If the in-memory object no longer
	exists, the server recreates it from the database.
</ul>

This all seems logical and reasonable. Since the ClassifiedAd object is
backed by Oracle, it shouldn't matter if, during the "time passes" step,
you take Oracle down, move the database to new hardware, give it the old
IP address, and fire up Oracle again.

<p> There are CORBA implementations that allow this sort of behavior,
by encoding the object's type and primary key in the object reference.
Alas, Oracle's isn't one of them. When the client exits after its first
run, all the remote objects it had accessed are destroyed. When you get
to the last step, and Oracle is your server, you get an OBJECT_NOT_EXIST
exception. Oracle's ORB is too primitive to recreate objects from object
references.

<p> Instead, the client must do this:

<ul>
	<li>The client looks up the <code>/acs</code> object in the
	registered object directory.
	<li>The client calls <code>ad = acs.get_most_recent_ad(some_user_id)</code>
	and gets back a reference to a ClassifiedAd.
	<li>The client calls <code>id = ad.get_id()</code>, and writes
	this stringified object reference to a file.
	<li>The client exits.
	<li>Time passes.
	<li>The client runs again.
	<li>The client looks up the <code>/acs</code> object in the
	registered object directory.
	<li>The client reads the classified ad id from disk, calls
	calls <code>ad = acs.get_ad_by_id(id)</code>,
	and gets back a reference to a ClassifiedAd.
	<li>The client calls <code>one_line = ad.get_one_line()</code> to get
	the one-line description of the ad.
</ul>

<p> Admittedly, the sequence doesn't look all that different. But now
the client can't just use the object reference directly in its second
run. It must look up the factory object in the namespace when it might
otherwise not need to, and it must call <code>get_ad_by_id</code>
instead of <code>string_to_object</code>. Both of these are extra
round-trips to the server (<code>string_to_object</code> does not
require a trip to the server). The client also needs to tell the
server how to recreate the object by using a class-specific method,
<code>get_ad_by_id</code>.

<p> Similar arguments apply for Oracle's EJB implementation. The EJB
specification defines the concept of "entity beans", which would be
persistent across runs, etc. But Oracle doesn't implement entity beans
as of 8.1.6.

<h3>Authentication</h3>

<p> Since we don't require each user to have a separate Oracle identity,
we can't use the Oracle CORBA security features for authentication and
authorization. Instead, after the client has authenticated itself to
Oracle using some shared identity, it looks up the ACS login object in
the namespace and calls its <code>login</code> method, in an e-mail
address and password. The <code>login</code> method raises an exception
on authentication failure. On success, it returns a new object that
knows the user's identity and provides methods for accessing the ACS.

<h3>Dates</h3>

CORBA does not define a standard way of representing dates and times.
(In the EJB interface we can just use <code>java.util.Date</code>, which
is serializable.)  There are basically three possibilities:

<ol>

	<li> Pass dates as strings in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS' format.

	<li> Pass dates in a structure containing separate fields for year,
	month, day, etc.  This basically means parsing the format from #1 on
	the server side instead of the client side.

	<li> Pass dates as seconds since the UNIX epoch. This style sends the
	least data on the wire and has direct support in the Java and C
	standard libraries.

</ol>
