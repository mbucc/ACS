The Customer Service Submodule can be found at

(it is also linked to from the main Ecommerce Administration page).

<h3>Issues and Interactions</h3>

There are two main concepts underlying the customer service submodule: customer service
interactions and customer service issues.

<p>

There is a many-to-many relationship between issues and interactions.  During the course
of one interaction, a customer may bring up any number of issues ("My credit card shows
a charge for $7.99, but I thought this ant farm was only supposed to cost $6.99 AND,
while I have you on the phone, I'd like to mention that delivery took three days instead
of the promised two.").  Furthermore, if an issue is not resolved the first time it is 
brought up, it might span any number of interactions until it is finally closed.

<p>
Issues can be categorized either for reporting purposes or so
that different departments of your company can handle the issues.  Open issues
are linked to from the front page of the customer service submodule to attract 
attention.  Whenever email is sent to the customer (either automatically or
by a customer service rep), an issue is created (or added to, if it is based
on a previous issue).  This is so that a complete interaction history containing
all correspondence to and from the customer can be maintained.  All issues created
due to automatic emails are closed immediately so that they don't get in the way of
other issues.

<p>
Small note: the intersection between an issue and an interaction is called an "action"
(i.e., the part of a specific interaction that deals with a specific issue).  This rarely
comes up.
<p>

<h3>Registered Users and Unregistered Users</h3>

As a customer service rep, much of your interaction may be with people who
have used the site but are not registered users (people don't become registered
users unless they log in when they order, when they submit product reviews, etc.),
yet you still want to capture the details of the interaction with as much
identifying information about them as you can.

<p>

Whenever you record a new interaction, you are asked to enter as much information
as you can gather (or feel comfortable gathering) about the user.  The system then
tries to match this person up with either registered users or unregistered people
who have had interacted previously with customer service.  If no match can be
made, a new "user identification record" is created.

<p>

Each time you view a user identification record, the system sees if it can
match that person up with a registered user of the system (in case they
have registered in the meantime).

<p>

<h3>Sending Email to Customers</h3>

When you're viewing a customer service issue, you can send the customer
email regarding that issue by clicking "send email" at the top of the page.
The contents of your email will automatically be added to the customer's
interaction history and will become part of the record for that customer
service issue.
<p>
If you find yourself using the same phrases over and over again when you
respond to customers' emails, the <a href="/admin/ecommerce/customer-service/canned-responses">Canned Response System</a> will be useful
to you.  You can enter your commonly used phrases once,
and then whenever you send email you'll
be able to automatically insert any number of these phrases.
<p>
If you want to send email to customers in bulk, then use the
<a href="/admin/ecommerce/customer-service/spam">Spam System</a>.
You can spam users based on what products they've bought, what products
they've even looked at, by when they've last visited, by how much they've
spent at your site, by which mailing lists they're signed up for.
If you're spamming customers that you like, you can
issue them all gift certificates at the same time.
<p>
Your email text is also sent through a spell checker before it is sent
to the customer.

<p>
<h3>Picklist Management</h3>

When your customer service data entry people are recording customer
interactions, you want it to take as little effort as possible.  One
way to help is to predefine picklists that they can choose from when
entering data.  With the <a href="/admin/ecommerce/customer-service/picklists">Picklist Management tool</a>,
you can specify what goes in what picklist in what order.

<h3>Reports</h3>

Reports and statistics are generated so that you can tell what types
of issues are occurring most frequently, which customer service reps
are handing the most interactions, what resources the reps need to use
most often, etc.  Each report can be filtered and
sorted in a variety of ways to give you a clear picture of what's
happening and what can be done to improve efficiency.
