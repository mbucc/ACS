<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

Corporations need a way of organizing their people, projects, and time.

<h3>The Medium Size Picture</h3>

Vital company knowledge lies in answers to the following questions.
<ul>
<li> Where is Betty Stripe today?
<li> What are our upcoming deadlines?
<li> What is John Smith working on?
<li> Which people are on the CNN project?
<li> How much time did that project take?
<li> What current issues and problems we are facing?
<li> What has this project involved so far?
</ul>



<h3>Core Components</h3>

The Project Tracker runs as part of the dedicated
ArsDigita Community System for your intranet.
Components of the Project Tracker are employees, 
customers, and projects.



<h4>Employees</h4>

Employees or key members of the company are users of the ArsDigita Community System. Detailed contact information is stored for users to provide a company directory. 

<p>
A "current information note" is used as a quick reference for employees' temporary contact information and other special items. Users are reminded to maintain their current information note in their workspace.
<p>
Email notifications remind users to keep their contact and current information note up to date.

<h4>Projects</h4>
<p>
Typical projects are 
<ul>
<li> A  client (iMedix)
<li> A module (Project Tracker Module)
<li> An initiative (convert company structure from LLC to SCorp)
</ul>

The <code>project_tracker_projects</code> table stores the main project information.
<blockquote>
<pre>
create sequence project_tracker_projects_id_seq;
create table project_tracker_projects (
        project_id       integer not null primary key,
	creator_user_id  integer references users,
	creation_date    date,
	name            varchar(200),
	--- the url of the staff server for this service, if applicable
	glassroom_url   varchar(100),
	start_date      date,
	end_date        date,
	-- if this project is for a customer, which one
	customer_id     integer references project_tracker_customers,
	--- purpose is sales, operations, customer
        purpose         varchar(100),
	--- major considerations for this project
	notes           varchar(4000),
);
</pre>
</blockquote>


Employees of the company are assigned to projects.
<blockquote>
<pre>
create table project_tracker_assignments (
       user_id          integer references users,
       project_id	integer references project_tracker_projects,
       creator_user_id  integer references users,
       creation_date    date,
       -- what the user does for this project
       role             varchar(4000),
       unique(project_id, user_id)
);
</pre>
</blockquote>


Each project has  major deadlines. Example 
deadlines are "initial launch", "site upgrade",
or "progress checkpoint".

<blockquote>
<pre>
create sequence project_tracker_deadline_id_seq;
create table project_tracker_deadlines (
    deadline_id      integer primary key,
    creator_user_id  integer references users,
    creation_date    date,
    name             varchar(200),
    start_date       date,
    due_date         date,
    description      varchar(4000),
    status_note      varchar(4000)
);
</pre>
</blockquote>

User's record time spent on each project or deadline.

<blockquote>
<pre>
create table project_tracker_hours (
     user_id           integer not null references users,
     project_id        integer not null references project_tracker_hours,
     deadline_id       integer reference project_tracker_deadlines,
     notes             varchar(4000),
     -- start_time and finish_time include date and time
     -- If total_hours is blank, we will assume that the
     -- user precisely enter the times and will calculate total_hours
     -- If total_hours is not blank, we will assume that start_time
     -- and end_time represent "general timeframes" and not try
     -- to recalculate total_hours
     start_time	       date,             
     finish_time       date,
     total_hours       number(5,2),
     -- billing rate is in dollars
     billing_rate      number(5,2) 
);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4>Customers</h4>

We store potential, current, and past customers.

<blockquote>
<pre>
create sequence project_tracker_customer_id_seq;
create table project_tracker_customers (
     customer_id      integer primary key,  
     creator_user_id  integer references users,
     creation_date    date
     name             varchar(200),
     -- we are not going to bother storing a ton
     -- of structure information
     -- To store individual contact records, use the contact-manager
     contact_info    varchar(4000),
     -- potential, current, past
     status         varchar(100),
     notes          varchar(4000)
);
</pre>
