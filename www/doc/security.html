<h2>Security in ACS</h2>

<h3>Chrooted AOLserver</h3>

In order to limit the amount of damage someone exploiting a security
hole in ACS can do, it is possible to run AOLserver in a chroot
environment (see <a
href="http://www.aolserver.com/documentation/3.0/admin/sec-ch2.htm#8704">http://www.aolserver.com/documentation/3.0/admin/sec-ch2.htm#8704</a>). The
tricky part to doing this is setting up a root directory that will let
the Oracle driver find all the files it needs to work.

<h3>Setting up the chroot directory</h2>

In order to keep things simple, we'll use the server directory as the
new root (let's call it <code>/home/aolserver</code>). We need to recreate
a few system directories and populate them:

<pre>
cd /home/aolserver
mkdir bin dev etc tmp usr var

# Create some device files necessary for Oracle.
# (The following is Solaris specific.)
cd dev
mknod kmem c 13 1
mknod mem c 13 0
mknod zero c 13 12
mknod null c 13 2
chmod a+w zero

# Copy necessary files to /etc.
cd ../etc
cp /etc/group /etc/hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf /etc/resolv.conf /etc/netconfig .
grep nsadmin /etc/passwd > passwd

# Create a symlink as /home/aolserver, so we don't have to edit all our
# .ini files.
cd ..
mkdir home
ln -s . home/aolserver

# Make tmp directory world writable.
chmod 1777 tmp 
mkdir var/tmp
chmod 1777 var/tmp

# Copy rm to bin.
cp /bin/rm bin

# Copy unzip to usr/bin.
mkdir usr/bin
cp /usr/bin/unzip usr/bin

# Copy shared libraries to usr.
# Note that it may be desirable to recompile
# with static linked binaries to avoid having
# these libraries in the chroot environment.
# See <A HREF="dynamic_linking_notes">dynamic_linking_notes</A>
# to get a more accurate list of files needed.
mkdir usr/lib
cp /usr/lib/*.a /usr/lib/*.so.* usr/lib

# If using the ecommerce module with ImageMagick to do image resizing,
# copy ImageMagick files.
mkdirhier usr/local/bin
mkdirhier usr/local/lib
cp /usr/local/bin/convert usr/local/bin
cp /usr/local/lib/ImageMagick* usr/local/lib
mkdirhier usr/openwin/lib
cp /usr/openwin/lib/libdpstk.so.5 usr/openwin/lib
cp /usr/openwin/lib/libdps.so.5 usr/openwin/lib
cp /usr/openwin/lib/libdpstk.so usr/openwin/lib
cp /usr/openwin/lib/libtif.so usr/openwin/lib

# Copy timezone files.
mkdirhier usr/share/lib
cp -r /usr/share/lib/zoneinfo usr/share/lib

# The page root must also be within the chroot environment.
mkdir web
mv /web/servername /home/aolserver/web

# (Optional) make a link to the chrooted pages from the old web directory
ln -s /home/aolserver/web/servername /web/servername

# Copy necessary Oracle files to new root.
mkdirhier /home/aolserver$ORACLE_HOME
cd /home/aolserver$ORACLE_HOME
(cd $ORACLE_HOME; tar cf - bin dbs lib network ocommon rdbms) | tar xvf -
</pre>

<h3>Setting up Oracle</h3>

Unfortunately, when running Oracle in dedicated server mode, each
client process starts up its own server process which requires direct
access to the data files. This will obviously not work in a chroot
environment unless all the Oracle data files are contained within the
chroot directory. This is not desirable and generally not possible.

<p>

One workaround for this is to connect to Oracle through a TCP
connection. This is by far the easiest to set up. The downside is that
there is some performance loss going through TCP instead of using IPC.
To do this, edit <code>$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora</code>
to add a TCP listener and
<code>$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora</code> to add a network
alias for that listener (see the <a
href="http://oradoc.photo.net/ora81/DOC/network.815/a67440/toc.htm">Net8
Administrator's Guide</a>, or just use netasst). Then have AOLserver
use it by putting the network alias as the <code>Datasource</code>
entry for the connection pool in your server's .ini file.

<p>

If you insist on using IPC, you must configure the database to run in
multi-threaded server (MTS) mode. Configuring MTS mode can be somewhat
tricky (see <a
href="http://oradoc.photo.net/ora81/DOC/server.815/a67772/manproc.htm#1369">this
8.1.5 doc</a> and <a href="http://oradoc.photo.net/ora816/network.816/a76933/mts.htm">this 8.1.6 doc</a>).  
In brief, you must:
<ul>

<li>add the following to your initSID.ora file:
<pre>
# Configure MTS for IPC connections and start up one server.
mts_dispatchers = "(PROTOCOL=IPC)(DISP=1)(mul=OFF)(pool=OFF)(PRES=TTC)"
mts_max_dispatchers = 5
mts_servers = 1
mts_max_servers = 20
</pre>

<li>Make sure there is an IPC listener configured in listener.ora:
<pre>
LISTENER =
  (DESCRIPTION_LIST =
    (DESCRIPTION =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = IPC)(KEY = EXTPROC))
    )
  )

SID_LIST_LISTENER =
  (SID_LIST =
    (SID_DESC = 
      (SID_NAME = PLSExtProc) 
      (ORACLE_HOME = /ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6) 
      (PROGRAM = extproc) 
    ) 
    (SID_DESC = 
      (GLOBAL_DBNAME = ora8) 
      (ORACLE_HOME = /ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6) 
      (SID_NAME = ora8) 
    ) 
  )
</pre>

<li>add a network alias to tnsnames.ora:
<pre>
ORA8_IPC =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = IPC)(KEY = EXTPROC))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVICE_NAME = ora8)
      (SRVR = SHARED)
    )
  )
</pre>

<li>and use that network alias as the datasource in your server's .ini file.
</ul>

<p>

To put Oracle into MTS mode, you must now restart the Oracle
server. The listener should be started before the server so that the
server can register itself properly with the listener. To verify that
Oracle is in MTS mode, connect to Oracle using "sqlplus
username/password@ora8_ipc" (substitute the network alias you put in
tnsnames.ora for ora8_ipc), and run this SQL statement: <code>select
username, program, server from v$session where
audsid=userenv('sessionid');</code>. It should return "SHARED" in the
SERVER column. If it says "DEDICATED" instead, your server is not in
MTS mode.

<p>

One last problem with running ACS in a chrooted environment is that
Oracle uses Unix domain socket files for IPC that are created in
/var/tmp/.oracle. We must replace /var/tmp/.oracle with a symlink to a
directory underneath the chroot directory. This must only be done with
Oracle shut down!

<pre>
cd /home/aolserver
mkdir var/tmp/.oracle
chown oracle var/tmp/.oracle
chmod 777 var/tmp/.oracle
# Make sure Oracle is not running before you do this next step!
rm -r /var/tmp/.oracle
ln -s /home/aolserver/var/tmp/.oracle /var/tmp/.oracle
</pre>

<p>

A caveat about specifying directories in .ini files: every path must
be relative to the chroot directory (e.g., /home/nsadmin/foo/bar ->
/foo/bar), <i>except</i> for AuxConfigdir, which must be an absolute
path.

<h3>Running AOLserver</h3>

At this point, you can run AOLserver using
<code>/home/aolserver/bin/nsd-oracle -ikc
/home/aolserver/servername.ini -r /home/aolserver</code> from
inittab. This, however, introduces a way to get out of the chroot
sandbox. The problem arises because /home/aolserver/bin/nsd-oracle and
bin/nsd8x, which it calls, are run by init, as root, outside of the
chroot environment. If someone were to replace either of those files
with a shell script that executes some other program (such as "rm -rf
/"), it will be executed by root.

<p>

The way to get around this problem is to move nsd8x, nsd-oracle, and
the server.ini file outside of the chroot environment, and run it
using <code>/somewhere/not/in/chroot/nsd-oracle -ikc
/somewhere/not/in/chroot/servername.ini -r /home/aolserver</code> from
inittab, where nsd-oracle calls /somewhere/not/in/chroot/nsd8x instead
of the one within the chroot environment.

<h3>Running ACS</h3>

Several modules in the ACS depend on the existence of other
programs. These programs should be installed in the appropriate
directory under your web root (i.e. /home/aolserver):

<ul>
<li><b>top</b> needs to be installed for admin/monitoring/top<br>
<b>Note that we do not recommend installing top in chroot</b>.  Recent versions of top require the
proc filesystem in the chroot environment to run, which is the sort of security risk that you are trying to
avoid with chroot.  You could use an older version of top based on kmem (since kmem is unfortunately needed for
our web serving),  or you could write a simple script to cat top (running outside the webserver's chroot jail) into a 
text file (inside the chroot jail) regularly and just display that text file from the monitoring page.
<li><b>ImageMagick</b> is required for ecommerce - see earlier file copying notes
<li><b>perl</b> is needed for watchdog<br>
   <ul><lh>This can be addressed in two ways:</lh>
       <li>Install perl and all associated library files in the chroot directory structure</li>
           <b>This is not recommended</b> - PERL is rather dangerous to be having in a chroot environment.
           If you do decide to go this route, be sure to manually enter the chroot environment and test 
           the script out to be sure that you have installed all of the files needed for PERL.</LI>
       <li>Compile aolserver-restart.pl with perlcc.  This is the preferred method, but will be more difficult
           than just installing PERL.  See <A HREF="#static_linking_notes">static linking notes</A> for more
           information</LI>
   </ul>
   If you do not compile aolserver-errors or install PERL in the chroot environment, <b>be sure to shut
   off watchdog</b> by setting WatchDogFrequency=0 in your parameters/yourservername.ini file.  Otherwise
   <defunct> processes will collect every time the server tries to run watchdog.
<li><b>qmail</b> is needed for ecommerce
<li><b>ispell</b>
<li><b>CVS</b> and <b>ssh</b> for the version control module
</ul>

<h3>Disk Issues</h3>

Chrooting a server requires that everything related to the running of
AOLserver reside under a single directory. This may cause problems
with disk space, since what before was split up onto two directories
(the server root and the page root) now must go under the same
directory. One workaround is to mount a separate disk as
/home/aolserver/web and symlink it to /web.

<A NAME="static_linking_notes"></A><h3>Static Linking Notes</h3>
In order to avoid having shared libraries in the chroot environment, and in particular to
avoid having PERL available, you may wish to recompile some binaries with static linking.
This may be as simple as adding the "-static" flag to the gcc compile command.  For PERL, it's a bit
more involved (note that this is only required if you want to run watchdog, since that's the only
place the webserver presently uses a PERL script):
<UL><LI>First, we need to determine if your PERL is dynamically or statically linked.
    <UL><LI>Go to your server's /bin directory.</LI>
        <LI>Run <tt>perlcc -sav aolserver-errors.pl</tt>.  Examine the output.  If you don't see a reference to the file
            "Fcntl.so", your PERL is probably statically linked: You should be able to cut-and-paste the last gcc command
            perlcc used, add "-static" to the end, and have a static aolserver-errors binary.</LI>
        <LI>If you do see a reference to "Fcntl.so" when running perlcc, your PERL is probably dynamically linked.
            You'll need to install another copy of PERL that is statically linked and compile with that (or, you could live
            with having shared libraries in your chroot environment - see <A HREF="#dynamic_linking_notes">
            dynamic linking notes</A>.)</LI>
    </UL>
    <LI>If your PERL is dynamically linked, you'll need to install a statically linked PERL:
       <UL>
          <LI> get a copy of perl5 (wget http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/src/5.0/perl5.005_03.tar.gz) and extract it.</LI>
          <LI>Change into your new perl5 directory and read the INSTALL file.</LI>
          <LI>Read the appropriate file in the hints subdirectory for your operating system.</LI>
          <LI>Run the Configure program, specifying "-Dusedl=n" for static linking (along with whatever
              other parameters the hints file recommended) (for our Solaris 2.7 (SunOS 5.7) systems, we used
              <tt>sh Configure -Dcc='gcc -B/usr/ccs/bin/' -Dusedl=n -Dprefix=/testroot/perl5 -Uusemymalloc</tt>)</LI> 
              (any directory you have write access to will do for the -Dprefix parameter)</LI>
          <LI>Run make, make test, and make install.  Watch for errors.  Read the INSTALL, README, and hints files
              again if you have errors.</LI>
       </UL>
    <LI>Maybe having a statically linked PERL is enough - try running the 
        <tt>path/perlcc -sav aolserver-errors.pl</tt> command again, 
        (be sure to specify the
        path to your new statically linked PERL, .ie. /testroot/perl5/bin/perlcc aolserver-errors.pl.  You may
        want to temporarily remove your normal PERL directory from your path to be sure you don't accidentally 
        use it), cut-and-paste the gcc command, and add "-static" as before.</LI>
    <LI>On a Solaris system, this will probably fail to link.  Solaris does not support static linking of a few 
        functions.  Work around this by including this <A HREF="fake_dl.c">fake_dl.c</A> file in the subdirectory
        and adding it after aolserver-errors.c on the gcc command line.  This will replace the dlopen, dlclose,
        dlsym, and dlerror functions with simple stubs - enough to link, but not enough to let a program work
        if it relied on those functions (specifically /etc/nsswitch.conf, such as getYYYbyZZZ, getpwYYY, etc) -
        but luckily our aolserver-errors program does not rely on these.</LI>
    <LI>Now you should have a statically linked aolserver-errors executable.  Feel free to delete your statically linked
        PERL, you won't need it to run aolserver-errors.</LI>
    <LI>Final verification: Manually test by chrooting w/ your webserver directory (the command will be something like
        <tt>sudo chroot /home/aolserver /bin/sh</tt>, but the directory, location of sh, and whether you need to use sudo could vary
        depending on your system).  Enter the aolserver-errors command from your parameters.ini file (with full path).  If 
        you get no error message, watchdog should be ready to go chrooted.
</UL>

<A NAME="dynamic_linking_notes"></A><h3>Dynamic Linking Notes</h3>
If you're willing to have shared libraries in your chroot environment, then you'll want to make sure you have
all of the .so files you need.  There are two ways to do this:
<UL><LI>For every binary file in your chroot environment, run it from within a chrooted shell, look for errors, copy the 
        missing .so file into the chroot environment, and repeat until the program works.  This is a slightly
        inferior method.</LI>
    <LI>For every binary file in your chroot environment, run <tt>ldd [filename]</tt> and note the .so files listed.
        Make sure that these .so files are in the chroot environment.  Repeat for the .so files, making sure any
        .so files they need are also in the chroot environment.  You can feel like a smarter better Unix user for 
        knowing how to use the list dynamic dependencies tool.</LI>
    <LI>Note that you should not need perl to be in the chroot environment even if it's dynamically linked - 
        you can compile your perl programs with perlcc, and just keep the libraries in the chroot jail.  This is 
        definitely better than providing access to perl, although it's not as ideal as having a statically linked
        program.  But try running them from within a chrooted shell when you're done anyway, just to be sure that you 
        got everything.</LI>
</UL>

<B>One last change for either static or dynamically linked</B>: Edit your parameters.ini file and replace 
"<tt>aolserver-errors.pl</tt>" with just "<tt>aolserver-errors</tt>".
