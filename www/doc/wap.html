<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

We want to make site content available to wireless devices like cell
phones.  The prototypical application is a WAP-accessible phone
directory which lets you look up a phone number by keying in the first
few letters of the person's name or email address, and then serves up
the number providing a link to call that number.

<h3>The Medium-Sized Picture</h3>

A WAP device connects to a gateway which issues HTTP requests on
behalf of the device.  No modifications of the web server itself are
needed---content is served over HTTP---but new headers and markup are
needed.  Pages are built according to the Wireless Markup
Language DTD, proposed and maintained by the <a
href="http://www.wapforum.com">WAP Forum</a>.

<p>

Besides learning new syntax, the major considerations when building
WAP pages are:

<ul>

<li><strong>Page flow:</strong> WAP devices typically have small
screens without much room for information. Rather than requiring that
a slow request be made for each page, WML provides a mechanism for
transmitting several discrete page views, or <em>cards</em>, in a single
document, or <em>deck</em>.  There are also provisions for passing
state information (i.e. variables) between cards in deck (and possibly
between different decks).

<li><strong>Verbosity:</strong> Small displays mean you don't have
room for lengthy explanations.

<li><strong>Applications:</strong> You can help the phone do nifty stuff like dial phone numbers thanks to the <a href="http://www1.wapforum.org/tech/terms.asp?doc=SPEC-WTAI-19991108.pdf">WTAI Specification</a>.

<li><strong>Code reuse:</strong> There's no absolute way to get around
the pain of managing parallel sets of pages.  If nothing else, you'll
want to serve up <em>less</em> content to smaller screens and perhaps
<em>more</em> to larger screens.  But there are ways to minimize the
pain by separating content from presentation (insert favorite X*
acronym here).

</ul>

<h3>The Gory Details</h3>

<ul>

<li>User login is handled by cookies in the usual way.

<li>To save the user a bit of typing at login time we provide
autocompletion of the email address using a default domain if the
user's input lacks an @ (see <a
href="proc-one?proc_name=wap%5fdefault%5femail%5fdomain">wap_default_email_domain</a>)

<li>We build a top level index for wap services in /wap/i.wap, which
should ultimately integrate with the module registry to
dynamically build a page of available services.

<li>All wap services will live under the /wap directory (subject to
change).

<li>The /admin directory contains tools for managing a list of known
WAP user agents, which can help you determine what type of device is
knocking at your door.

<p>

<li>Documented procedures: see wap-defs section of <a
href="/doc/procs">ACS API documentation</a>

</ul>

<font color=red><b>Note for programmers who have worked with the
ACS-3.3 version:</b>As of ACS-3.4, <code>wap_begin_output</code>
and <code>wap_begin_output_no_cache</code> return a string to the
caller, rather than writing directly to the connection.</font>
This change was made so that we can return the WML document with
a single call to <code>ns_return</code>, in keeping with 3.4 standards.

<h3>The Steps</h3>

To add wap services to your module:
<ol>

<li>Add a link to your service in the top level page at /wap/i.wap
     (this needs to be integrated with the module registry).

<li>Learn to code WML.  You might want to read <a
     href="http://www1.wapforum.org/tech/documents/SPEC-WML-19991104.pdf">the
     WML specification</a>.

<li>For logic, make use of the API functions in wap-defs.  Useful
     procs: <a
     href="http://acs-staging.arsdigita.com/doc/proc-one?proc_name=util%5fguess%5fdoctype">util_guess_doctype</a>,
     <a
     href="http://acs-staging.arsdigita.com/doc/proc-one?proc_name=wap%5fmaybe%5fredirect%5ffor%5fregistration">wap_maybe_redirect_for_registration</a>,
     <a
     href="http://acs-staging.arsdigita.com/doc/proc-one?proc_name=wap%5freturnredirect">wap_returnredirect</a>,
     <a href="proc-one?proc_name=wml%5freturn">wml_return</a>

<li>For debugging, you may want to run a WAP-enabled browser on your PC.
    These can be downloaded from
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://updev.phone.com">Unwired Planet Developer Website</a> (requires free registration)
    <li><a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/main">Nokia</a>, in the WAP Developer Forum area (requires free registration)
    <li><a href="http://www.ericsson.com/developerszone">Ericcson Developer's Zone</a> (requires free registration)
    <li><a href="http://www.opera.com/download">Opera 4.0 browser</a>
    </ul>
    Alternatively, the telnet method works quite well too.

</ol>
