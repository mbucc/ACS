<h2>Upgrading an ACS Installation</h2>
part of <a href="">the ACS docs</a> by <a href="http://www.pinds.com/lars">Lars Pind</a>
<hr>


This document will walk you through upgrading ACS from one major
version to the next. If you need to upgrade across several major
versions, take them one at a time. If you haven't kept up-to-date for
a <i>really</i> long time, it may be better to start afresh and invent
a way to move your old data into the new system. See the <a
href="upgrading">other upgrading document</a> for how to do that.

<p>

The process being outlined here involves shutting the site down for an
hour or two while the upgrade takes place. We'll update the document
later to include how to do it without taking the live site down.

<p>

The steps are:

<ol>

<li>Stop you webserver.

<li>Download and untar the new version.

<li>Import the new files and resolve conflicts.

<li>Back up your database.

<li>Figure out what minor version your database is at.

<li>Upgrade the database.

<li>Do any version-specific upgrade tasks.

<li>Start the webserver.

<li>Test.

</ol>

<h3>1. Stop Your Webserver</h3>

Turn off the line for your webservice in
<code>/etc/inittab</code>. Remember that you can't comment out lines
in inittab on Solaris. Instead, change <code>respawn</code> to
<code>off</code>. Then type <code>init q</code> on the command line to
have the server process killed.


<h3>2 and 3. Download, Untar, Import, Resolving Conflicts</h3>

This is already described in detail in <a
href="http://www.arsdigita.com/doc/runbook/project-management#upgrade">the
project management document</a> in the ACS Runbook.


<h3>4. Back Up Your Database</h3>

You can do this with 

<blockquote><pre>
exp <i>yourservice</i>/<i>password</i> owner=<i>yourservice</i> file=<i>yourservice</i>.dmp consistent=y
</pre></blockquote>

Make sure it completes without hickups.

<h3>5. Figure Out Your Minor Version</h3>

If you're in doubt, fire up SQL*Plus, open the first minor upgrade
script for your major version (e.g. <code>upgrade-3.2-3.2.1.sql</code>
and check if the first few changes from that file have been done with
<code>describe <i>objectname</i></code>. Continue till you find
something that hasn't been done, and here's where you should start.

<h3>6. Upgrade The Database</h3>

Programmers make mistakes. We haven't been good enough at testing in
the past. Therefore, we urge you to interactively run the upgrade
scripts, rather than run the automatically. That way you'll know what
worked and what didn't and resolve the problems by hand. This is
especially a good idea, if you've made custom development on top of
the toolkit.

<p>

The most convenient way to do it is to fire up SQL*Plus in a shell
buffer in Emacs (<code>M-x rename-buffer</code> to
<code>sqlplus</code>), then open the upgrade script in another buffer
(you probably already have it open from step 5).

<p>

Copy the stuff from the upgrade-script buffer to the SQL*Plus buffer
bit by bit and make sure there aren't any problems. The upgrade
scripts are divided into blocks concerning each their part. Experience
shows that if the first few statements in a block succeed, you can
be reasonably safe taking larger chunks from within that block, but go
by your intuition.



<h3>7. Version-specific Upgrade Tasks</h3>

Some versions have specific things you need to do. For example, ACS
3.3 requires you to deleted some files in special places. Check the
<a href="release-notes/">release notes</a> for these.

<h3>8. Start the Web Server</h3>

Fire up another shell in Emacs, and do a 

<blockquote><pre>tail -f /home/aol30/log/<i>yourserver</i>-error.log</pre></blockquote>

Change <code>/etc/inittab</code> back, so it says <code>respawn</code>
again, and <code>init q</code>. Check that the webserver is running.
Search for "Error" or other suspicious-looking messages in the error
log.


</h3>Test</h3>

Surf around your website, to make sure that everything worked okay.
