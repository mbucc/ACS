<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

Surfing the Web can seem like an aimless unproductive activity.  This
system enables a publisher to establish a curriculum at their site,
identifying up to a dozen or so important areas of content that they'd
like a user to visit eventually.

<P>

Suppose that Joe User comes to <a href="http://www.edf.org">www.edf.org</a> hoping to learn something
about being an environmentalist.  He reads an article or two before
becoming distracted by another task.  Three months later, Joe User
returns to www.edf.org to continue his environmentalism education.  He
can't remember which articles he has read.  The home page has been
freshened with news so that the links aren't in familiar places.  Joe
doesn't know what he should read next and, worse, doesn't feel that he
is progressing toward any goal.

<p>

With this system, Joe can refer to a curriculum bar that is displayed on
every page grabbed from www.edf.org.  The bar shows a condensed
description of the articles that Environmental Defense Fund wants
everyone to read, with little checkboxes by the ones that he has read
already.  As Joe finishes a section, it is clear from referring to the
curriculum bar which section to read next.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>
[ns/server/yourserver/acs/curriculum]
EnabledP=1
; does ad_footer put this in every dynamic page?
StickInFooterP=1
; does ad_serve_html_page put this on every static page?
StickInStaticPagesP=1
</code></pre>
</blockquote>



<h3>What we need to represent</h3>

We need to store 

<ul>
<li>the overall objective of the curriculum at this site 
<li>for each element 
<ul>
<li>the URL of the element (can be off the site)
<li>the position within the curriculum
<li>a very very short name (one or two words)
<li>a one-line description for an outline
<li>a full description of the pedagogical value of this element

</ul>

</ul>

The overall objective is kept in an optional /curriculum/objective.txt
file.  This contains an HTML fragment that the publisher wants the user
to see.

<p>

Everything else is in the following table

<blockquote>
<pre><code>
create table curriculum (
	curriculum_element_id	integer primary key,
	-- 0 is the first element of the course, 8 would be the 9th
	element_index		integer,
	url			varchar(200) not null,
	very_very_short_name	varchar(30) not null,
	one_line_description	varchar(200) not null,
	full_description	varchar(4000)
);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

We record individual user experiences in 

<blockquote>
<pre><code>
create table user_curriculum_map (
	user_id			not null references users,
	curriculum_element_id	not null references curriculum,
	completion_date		date default sysdate not null,
	primary key (user_id, curriculum_element_id)
);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

You might wonder why we don't use the <code>user_content_map</code>
table.  We have some good reasons:  (a) the table only records static
 page loads, (b) the table is only properly used to record content
viewed on our server whereas a curriculum may include content from
foreign sites.

<h3>Registered vs. Non-registered Learners</h3>

The system needs to work for non-registered learners via browser
cookies.  At the same time, someone who does register ought to be able
to claim their curriculum progress when logging in from another browser.


<h3>Where displayed</h3>

Our canonical location for the curriculum bar is at the bottom of
the page, just above the HR tag the precedes the signature.  We can get
this into most  pages by making <code>ad_footer</code> check for the
publisher's curriculum system settings.  A modification to
<code>ad_serve_html_page</code> in /tcl/ad-html suffices to make
the bar visible on static pages.

<h3>When displayed</h3>

Once a user has completed the curriculum the bar is no longer displayed
unless the user explicitly clears the curriculum history from the
/curriculum/ pages.

<h3>Performance</h3>

Anything that can be memoized is, e.g., the elements of the curriculum
at a site.  Anything that can be pushed into a browser cookie is.  We
don't want to hit Oracle one extra time for every page load.


<h3>Cookies Employed</h3>

For both registered and non-registered users, we keep a browser cookie
<code>CurriculumProgress</code>.

<P>

This is either a space-separated list of integers (curriculum element
IDs) or the token "finished".


<h3>Filters</h3>

We want to make sure that curriculum progress is recorded even if a user
does not navigate to sections via the curriculum bar.  So we'll need a
filter that checks the URL against the curriculum elements and that
checks the user's CurriculumProgress cookie.  For the curriculum bar to
be up to date, the filter will have to run before the page is served and
destructively modify the input header ns_set to make CurriculumProgress
reflect the current page.

<p>

By default, the filter ought to be run before every , , or .adp
page served, if the curriculum system is enabled.
