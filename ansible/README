Try and use Ansible to build an ACS 3.0 server
Created: Tue Aug 20 19:14:30 EDT 2013

Status

    Provisions functional system:
        * Arsdigita Community System (version 3.4.10)
        * Oracle 11.2g
        * AOLServer 3.5.11
        * Oracle Linux (

    Known issues (there probably are others):

        * Cassandracle monitoring queries don't work.

        * Email is not configured.

        * ecommerce, clickthrough and CRM modules are not installed.

        * SSL not working (ns module built, just not configured).

        * Search is not working (Oracle Text is installed).

        * The ACS parameter file needs some attention.

        * The data backup scripts are not installed.

Setup

    1. Set up vagrant box and point ansible to the box.

    2. Run: ansible-playbook playbook.yml.

        $ ansible-playbook -v playbook.yml

          WARNING: If you have ACS data, it may be deleted.
                   (The idempotency of the SQL in the ansible play
                   books is a work in progress.)

Oracle Licensing

    For a web app, you need to buy the per-cpu (Named users is every
    user, not every application connection.)  The lowest per CPU
    license is over $1,100.

    So use Oracle Express.  It's free to use in production for one
    CPU and up to 11GB of user data.  The base ACS install only
    takes 20MB of user data (0.2% of this quota). Once I hit to 2
    or 3 GB of user data, I'll look into using PostgreSQL.

      Oracle Linux.  Considered Ubuntu, but it looked non-trivial to run Oracle there.
