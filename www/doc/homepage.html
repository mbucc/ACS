<h3>0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

The homepage module is about users maintaining their homepages and
publishing web content.
<p>

<b>0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abilities</b>
<p>

The Homepage Module gives users of the site the ability to publish
content on the world-wide-web. The users can create their own
heirarchical directory structure to organize their content on the
site. The not-so-advanced users and others who want to publish large
amounts of content and wish to give their content a consistent look,
can create special "managed content" directories in their file
system. This would be useful for publishing content like books etc
which require a considerable level of consistency between all the
parts (chapters in the case of books) of the publication. This in no
way hampers the endeavours of advanced html publishers who would like
to maintain their own filesystem since they can choose not to use
content managed directories and have full control over the look and
feel of their web pages.
<p>

<b>0.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inabilities</b>
<p>

The homepage module does not let users to author server side scripts,
althought users are free to use client side scripts in html using the
<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. The module does not provide users with a database
handle and therefore cannot be used to author database backed
webpages.
<p>

<h3>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User's Manual</h3>

This section provides information regarding the use of the homepage
module by the end users. Users have the facility to have their
webpages on the system if the homepage module is enabled on their
system. The users do not need to know html really, but they can learn
sufficient html within five blinks of an eye by reading the lower
parts of sections 1.1.4.2 and 1.1.4.5.1 of this document.
<p>

<b>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homepage Maintenance</b>
<p>

If the homepage module is enabled in your system, three links should
appear in your workspace: "Homepage Maintenance", "Neighborhoods", and
"User Homepages". The "Homepage Maintenance" link is for maintining
you own homepage and mainting the content you publish. The
"Neighbourhoods" page is for browsing through neighbourhoods and
viewing their members or joining one of them. You can leave your
neighbourhood by clicking on "leave it!" link on the neighbourhoods
page (this link appears only when you are the member of a
neighbourhood).
<p>

1.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neighbourhoods Page
<p>
The neighbourhoods page lets you browse through neighbourhoods. You
can join a neighbourhood by clicking on the [join] button besides a
neighbourhood's entry in the list. Similarly, the [members] button
lets you view all the members of a neighbourhood. As a normal user,
you cannot create, modify, delete, move, or rename neighbourhoods. An
attempt at doing so will result only in a meaningless error message
such as "Insufficient permission to perform requested database access
in AddNeighborhood". The neighbourhoods page is located at
/homepage/neighbourhoods. Alternatively, there is a link to it
from your workspace.
<p>

1.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User Homepages
<p>
A list of the users who have initialized their webspace (webspace
initialization is discussed in 1.1.3) can be seen at
/homepage/all. There is a link to it, marked as "User Homepages",
at your workspace.
<p>

1.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Webspace Initialization
<p>

This section discusses using the "homepage maintenance" option for the
first time.
<p>

1.1.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Root Directory Creation
<p>
You need to initialize your webspace before you can use the homepage
module for the first time. When you attempt to go to the "Homepage
Maintenance" page from your workspace or by visiting /homepage/, a
message appears which reads "Your webspace has not been activated
yet. Click here to set it up for the first time." Just click on "here"
in the "... Click here to ..." and your webspace will be
initialized. This process should take about a few hundred
microseconds. In this process, the system creats a root directory for
you and this is depicted by the consumption of some meagre amount of
your quota space (typically 2,048 bytes). Once it is done, you can
start maintaining your webpage if you already have a screen name set up.
<p>

1.1.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting up a screen name
<p>
If you have initialized your webspace but do not have a screen name
yet, the "homepage maintenance" page /homepage/ displays a message
with reads "You have not set up a screen name as yet. Click here to
set one up.". You can set up your screen name by clicking on the
"here" or alternatively, you can set up your screen name by clicking
on the "update" link in your "Basic Information" section in your
workspace /pvt/home.
<p>

1.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homepage Maintenance Page
<p>
The homepage maintenance page is at /homepage/. You use it to maintain
your web content once your webspace has been initialized and you have
set up a screen name for yourself.
<p>

1.1.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customizing your Maintenance and Public Pages
<p>
You can change the display settings of your maintenance page by
clicking on the [display-settings] link in the lower right of the
page. There are two types of settings: settings for public pages, and
settings for maintenance pages. The settings will affect your public
and maintenance pages respectively. Your public pages are the pages
shown to the entire world and are available at
http://yourdomain.com/users/your_screen_name. Your maintenance page is
/homepage/, the page through which you maintain your webspace. You can
also customize the way you view your files. The directory listing can
be normal or hierarchical. This can be set using the [ normal view |
tree view ] buttons at the upper right of the screen. By clicking on a
directory, you browse its content (in the normal view), or you browse
content rooted at it (in the tree view).
<p>

1.1.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating Files
<p>
You can create files by clicking on the "create file" link. You will
be prompted for the name, and an empty file with that name will be
created. Mind however that to be able to invoke the editor on a file,
it should have a .text, , .htm, .txt or anyother extension that
represents a mime type of text/*. If you're unsure of what this means,
just end the filename in  if it's an html file or .text if it's a
text file. If you do not know html then, for your own good, I advise
you to learn it. It is a very good advice. Take it. Html is very very
easy to learn. Meanwhile, you can just name your files ending with
.text or just use the "publish content" option. It requires no
knowledge of html. The created file is placed in the directory you are
currently browsing. Html files have the following format:<br>
<code>
<code>&lt;html&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;head&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;title&gt;</code><i>title-goes-here</i><code>&lt;/title&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;/head&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;body&gt;</code><br>
<br>
<i>body-text-goes-here</i><br>
<br>
<code>&lt;/body&gt;</code><br> <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code><br> </code><br> To learn about the
things you can do in the body text, read the lower half of section
1.1.4.5.1 of this document

<p>

1.1.4.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Index files and generated indices
<p>
If a web user requests a file from your webspace which is actually a
directory, then the system generates a default index page for it. The
format of the index page is such: your portrait (if you uploaded one
following the links in your workspace) in the top right, your name as
heading, and "webspace at your-system-name" as subheading. Then it
displays a listing of files in the directory. If you do not wish to
have a generated index, you can create an index file in that
directory. By default filenames index, index.htm, and Default.htm
will be treated by the system as index files and will be served when a
directory is requested by the web browser. The presence of an index
file makes it impossible for the web browser to lit the contents of
that directory.
<p>

1.1.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uploading Files
<p>
You can upload files from your local computer to your homepage
webspace by clicking on the "upload file" link. You can either type
the full filename on the local filesystem or press the browse button
to browse your local filesystem to select the file you want to
upload. Please mind your limited quota space before deciding on which
files to upload.
<p>

1.1.4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating Folders
<p>
Create folders using the "create folder" link. You are prompted for a
folder name and a description. Choose a nice description for your
folders as these descriptions are displayed alongside the folder name
in the generated index pages which the world sees. You can remove,
rename, or move folders by using the remove, rename, and move links
respectively. A folder which is not empty cannot be deleted.
<p>

1.1.4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invoking the Content Manager
<p>
Click the "publish content" link to publish managed content on your
site. You have to provide four parameters to the content manager: the
content type, short name, full name, and subsections. Content type
determines the type of your content. It can be anything from "book",
"magazine", "newsletter", "encyclopedia", to anything you can come up
with. The short name is a short name which describes the content. A
specially marked folder with that name is created to store the
content. The full name is the full name of your content. For example,
if you're publishing your book then this ought to be the complete
title of the book etcetra. In subsections, provide what one subsection
of the content is called. For a book, this could be "chapter". If the
content type is chapter, this could be "section". Please mind that you
must provide a singular in this field.
<p>

1.1.4.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managing Content
<p>
I will illustrate this with an example. Suppose I click on "publish
content" and create content of type "magazine", short name "mobmag",
full name "Mobin's Foolish Magazine", and subsections "article". This
tells the content manager that I wish to publish a magazine which is
composed of articles (multiple level hierarcies in content is possible
but not discussed here). The content manager creates a folder "mobmag"
(which is marked as a a magazine). When I click on "mobmag" to browse
its contents, I see one file in it already, "Introductory Text". You
can only edit or remove this file. The web viewer sees the contents of
this file on the main magazine page (in this case
http://mydomain.com/users/mobin/mobmag/) above the table of
contents. To add an article, click on the "add article" link. This
adds an empty article which you can then edit. While creating
articles, choose meaningful descriptions for them. You can use html in
these files if you want. This gives you the ability to show uploaded
photos i your web content. The contents of these files are pasted
within larger html files when these are served so you should not use
the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;body&gt;</code> etcetra tags. Also, since these files are
really html, you will need to escape <code>&lt</code>,
<code>&gt</code>, and <code>&</code> with <code>&amp;lt</code>,
<code>&amp;gt</code> and <code>&amp;amp</code> respectively if any of these are
used as text. So you can enclose text within the
<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h2&gt;</code> to make it a
second level heading, <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;/b&gt;</code> to make it bold, <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;/i&gt;</code> to make it italicised and more importantly,
you can use something like <code>&lt;a href=http://<i>whatever
address</i>&gt;</code><i>whatever link name</i><code>&lt;/a&gt;</code>
to provide a link to any addess on the web. Also, you can have
something like <code>&lt;img src=<i>picture-filename</i>&gt;</code> to
display the picture which has the name <i>picture-filename</i>. This
way you can upload picture files and then show them in your documents.
<p>

1.1.4.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deleting Managed Directories
<p>
Delete all files in a managed directory by using the remove links next
to them and then go to the parent directory and then remove the
managed directory.
<p>

<h4>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitewide Administration</h4>

Administration features are available even if the module is not
enabled. Administration is tied into users administration
/admin/users/ and administrators can additionally change a user's
screen name, change user's quota space, or become a user. This last
one, reminiscent of the unix command "su" is a very powerful
feature. Administration comes in three flavours really: user
administration, neighbourhood administration, and user content
administration.
<p>

1.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User Administration
<p>

User administration is the same as has been before. Its directory is
/admin/users/ However, the homepage module has introduced the concept
of user quotas. Also, there had been a long felt need for screen names
for users in ACS. With the homepage module, this need exceeded the
threshold level and we incorporated them into the main ACS users
table. The administration of screen names and user quotas is done via
/admin/users/ Thus the homepage module doesn't really have a site wide
administration directory of its own. Its administration is mainly done
via /admin/users/
<p>

1.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neighbourhood Administration
<p>

Administration of neighbourhoods is done at
/homepage/neighbourhoods. This page will hereby be referred to as
the "neighbourhoods page". If the homepage module is enabled in your
system, a link should appear to the neighbourhoods page at your
workspace. The neighbourhoods page is essentially for browsing through
neighbourhoods, viewing their members or even joining a
neighbourhood. Additionally, site wide administrators can create
neighbourhoods by pressing the [create-neighborhood] button above the
neighbourhoods listing; remove neighbourhoods by pressing the [remove]
button besides a neighbourhoods name; change neighbourhood hierarchy
by pressing the [move] button and moving neighbourhoods around; or
change the name or description of a neighbourhood by pressing the
[rename] button besides a neighbourhood name. Administrators should
mind the five hundred letter maximum limit on neighbourhood names and
a four thousand letter limit on neighbourhood descriptions.
<p>

1.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User Content Administration
<p>

Situations may arise where an administrator will need to remove user
content or take other such actions etcetra. In such a situation, the
administrator can go to /admin/users/, search for the appropriate user
and click on the "become this user!" link. This allows the
administrator to become any user he or she might need to. (Just like
the unix "su" command which lets the root swith into other
users). This means that now administrators can do anything that a user
can do. Administrators could become other users previously (by
forcibly changing their password and logging in as them) but this is a
much cleaner and acceptable way of doing that. Ofcourse,
administrators must not misuse this feature and should use it only to
administer when other means are unavailable.
<p>


<h3>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical Documentation</h3>

This section describes the mechanics of the homepage module and
concerns developers. Sections 2.1 to 2.4 discuss the different
components of the module: User Quota Management, Filesystem and Access
Management, Content Management, and Neighbourhood Management. Section
2.5 talks about how we connect these four components together.
<p>

<h4>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User Quota Management</h4>

Users of the system have a limited max quota for storing their web
content and uploaded files. The default values for the quotas are
determined by some of the variables in the ad.ini file.
<p>
<code>
;&nbsp;Maximum&nbsp;quota&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;'normal&nbsp;user'&nbsp;(a&nbsp;lesser&nbsp;mortal&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>
;&nbsp;site&nbsp;wide&nbsp;administrator)&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;site&nbsp;in&nbsp;mega-bytes.&nbsp;For&nbsp;example,&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>
;&nbsp;'20'&nbsp;corresponds&nbsp;to&nbsp;20,971,520&nbsp;bytes.&nbsp;Values&nbsp;need&nbsp;not&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;integer.&nbsp;<br>
;&nbsp;Value&nbsp;is&nbsp;overridden&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;particular&nbsp;user&nbsp;&nbsp;throught&nbsp;existence&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>
;&nbsp;entry&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;users_special_quotas&nbsp;table.<br>
NormalUserMaxQuota=5<br>
<br>
;&nbsp;Maximum&nbsp;quota&nbsp;for&nbsp;site&nbsp;wide&nbsp;administrators.&nbsp;&nbsp;Special&nbsp;quotas&nbsp;can&nbsp;be&nbsp;<br>
;&nbsp;set&nbsp;by&nbsp;adding&nbsp;rows&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;users_special_quotas&nbsp;table.&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;param<br>
;&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;used&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;site&nbsp;wide&nbsp;administrator&nbsp;only&nbsp;when&nbsp;he/she&nbsp;doesnt<br>
;&nbsp;have&nbsp;an&nbsp;entry&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;users_special_quotas&nbsp;table.<br>
PrivelegedUserMaxQuota=20<br>
<br>
;&nbsp;Space&nbsp;taken&nbsp;by&nbsp;a&nbsp;directory&nbsp;(in&nbsp;bytes).&nbsp;We&nbsp;need&nbsp;this&nbsp;so&nbsp;that&nbsp;a&nbsp;user&nbsp;<br>
;&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;crash&nbsp;the&nbsp;system&nbsp;by&nbsp;creating&nbsp;millions&nbsp;of&nbsp;directories.&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;<br>
;&nbsp;will&nbsp;ensure&nbsp;that&nbsp;a&nbsp;directory&nbsp;detracts&nbsp;from&nbsp;his/her&nbsp;quota.<br>
DirectorySpaceRequirement=2048<br>
</code>
<p>

NormalUserMaxQuota and PrivelegedUserMaxQuota are specified in
megabytes... which means that a 5 for example, corresponds to a quota
space of 5,242,880 bytes. DirectorySpaceRequirement determines the
amount of bytes to detract from the user's available quota for every
directory he or she creates. This is useful because directories do
take up space on the filesystem and we do not want to give a user the
license to harm our system by creating a few hundred thousand
directories.
<p> 

Users can have special quotas if they have an entry in the
users_special_quotas table:
<p>
<pre><code>
-- users have their quotas specified by [ad_parameter PrivelegedUserMaxQuota 
-- users] or [ad_parameter  NormalUserMaxQuota users]  depending on  whether 
-- they are site wide administrators or not. However, some users might  have 
-- special quotas which can be granted  by site  wide administrators.  These 
-- quotas are recorded in the users_special_quotas table. If a  user has  an 
-- entry in this table then the above mentioned parameter values are ignored 
-- and instead max_quota is used as his/her quota space.

create table users_special_quotas (
	user_id			integer primary key references users,
	max_quota		number not null,
	modification_date	date default sysdate not null
);
</code></pre>
<p>

An entry in this table overrides the default quotas specified by the
parameters. Special quotas can be assigned/removed only by site wide
administrators using the users admin pages /admin/users/
<p>
This dichotomy of user quota values (special quotas in Oracle and
default quotas in parameters) results in long sql queries when
querying the database from Tcl files for remaining quota space for a
user. For example:
<p>
<pre>
select ((decode((select count(*) from
                users_special_quotas
                where user_id=$user_id),
                0, [ad_parameter [ad_decode $admin_p \
                         0 NormalUserMaxQuota \
                         1 PrivelegedUserMaxQuota \
                         NormalUserMaxQuota] users],
                (select max_quota from
                 users_special_quotas
                 where user_id=$user_id))) * power(2,20)) -
      ((select count(*) * [ad_parameter DirectorySpaceRequirement users]
        from users_files
        where directory_p='t'
        and owner_id=$user_id) +
       (select nvl(sum(file_size),0)

<h4>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filesystem and Access Management</h4>

User files are stored on the filesystem. They are not stored as BLOBs
in Oracle. This is due to the fact that serving content from the
database keeps the database handle engaged for the entire duration of
the transmission (unless we come up with a way to first read the BLOB
in a C structure and then serve the content after conveniently
releasing the handle). Nevertheless, as I was saying, we store user
content on the filesystem. The content is rooted at [ad_parameter
ContentRoot users]:<br>
<pre>
; all user  web content will be rooted  under  this directory.  This
; directory will be the root of  all the web content being published
; by the users of the system.
ContentRoot=/web/acsdev/users/
</pre>
Each user's personal content is rooted under [ad_parameter ContentRoot
users]$user_id where $user_id is the user's unique id in the users
table.
<p>
We do store meta data in the users_files table:<br>
<pre>
-- We use this sequence to assign values to file_id. The 
-- reason for starting from 2 is that no file is special 
-- enough to have file_id=1, or is there a file that is?

create sequence users_file_id_seq start with 2;

create table users_files (
	file_id			integer primary key,

<h4>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content Management</h4>

The content manager which manages the look and feel of published
content is described in sections 1.1.4.5 to 1.1.4.5.2 of this
document. It creates a new specially marked directory for the content
being published and each subsection is physically represented by a
file on the filesystem underneath that directory. The file
"Introductory Text" is automatically created when the content
directory is created. These files can contain html-bodies and are
edited using our standard text editor. People can publish sub-content
from withing a specially managed directory to achieve hierarchical
content publishing. The information on the content types for the
directories is stored in the users_content_types table and the
content_type column in users_files references
users_content_types(type_id). Non-managed simple directories (folders)
have a null pointer in their content_type column.

<h4>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neighbourhood Management</h4>

Neighbourhoods are created in a somewhat similar fashion to folders,
only that they do not have anything to do with the physical
filesystem. Neighbourhoods can have a hierarchical structure but
cannot contain cycles in the hierarchy (just like the homepage
filesystem). Neighbourhood information is stored in the
users_neighborhoods table:<br>

	parent_id		integer references users_neighborhoods on delete cascade
);

A special "big kahuna" neighbourhood is always created to serve as the
root node of the neighbourhood hierarchy. The name of this super
parent neighbourhood is "Neighborhoods". It could be any name
really. It could have any neighborhood_id really. But it must exist.
<pre>
-- the system is smart enough to adjust if the root neighborhood
-- has a different neighborhood_id.

<h4>2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting it all together</h4>

At the heart of the homepage module is the users_homepages table. This
table contains information about each user's webspace and his/her
homepage display settings. An entry in this table signifies that the
user's webspace is initialized. Although, we use the existance of
[ad_parameter ContentRoot]$user_id as a test for webspace
initialization. This one should in theory serve equally well (The
other test is better as it does not require a db handle) and because
its truer, if there is such a word as truer.
