<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

We want to let publishers decide how many hurdles and approvals a user
must get through before being authorized to use the system.

<h3>Medium Size Picture</h3>

A typical public access web site might simply ask for your
name and email to give you a unique identity and for user tracking.
Sites concerned about personal misrepresentation will require an email verification
step. Your active membership base will be in flux as leave and other you restrict. 
For sensitive applications (ie - medical tracking systems), access 
control becomes more serious. 
Here, required options include approval systems, encrypting passwords in the
database.  This module allows a site administrator to set up an
access control system by choosing from a palette of options.
<p>
To simplify the user authentication, a finite state machine is used
to control the user's state. Users with access to the system
have a user_state of 'authorized'. 

<h3>Registration Options</h3>

<h3>Registration Finite State Machine</h3>

A user must be in the authorized state to have access to
the system. Prior to approval, users must pass 
"Need Email Verification" and "Need Admin Approval" tests.  
Users may be "Rejected" at
an stage prior to the "Authorized" state. 
One a user is "Authorized", they may be "Deleted" or "Banned".
"Deleted" users may self-activate.


<blockquote>
<pre>

			Not a user
		     	     |	
		             V
	           Need Email Verification          Rejected (via any
	             Need Admin Approval             pre-authorization state)
   			     |				
   		   	     |  	                
Need admin approval<--------- ------------->Need email verification 
   |						        |
   |                 		 			|
   --------------------->Authorized<---------------------                       
                             |
        		     |		  
 Banned------------><-------- ------><---------------Deleted
</pre>
</blockquote>

Following ACS convention, states in the database are represented by
lowercase tokens, sometimes with underscores:

<blockquote>
<pre><code>
user_state		varchar(100) 
  check(user_state in ('need_email_verification_and_admin_approv', 
                       'need_admin_approv', 
                       'need_email_verification', 
                       'rejected', 
                       'authorized', 
		       'banned', 
		       'deleted'))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>


<h3>Restricting to authorized users</h3>


The <code>users_active</code> view contains only authorized users:
<blockquote>
<pre>
--- users who are not deleted or banned 
--- (not that this does not have approval system)

create or replace view users_active
as select * from users 
 where user_state = 'authorized';

</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>

The <code>users_spammable</code> view contains active users that 
may be spammed:
<blockquote>
<pre>
create or replace view users_spammable
as select u.* from users u, users_preferences up
 where u.user_id = up.user_id(+)
 and (on_vacation_until is null or 
      on_vacation_until < sysdate)
 and user_state = 'authorized'
 and (email_bouncing_p is null or email_bouncing_p = 'f')
 and (dont_spam_me_p is null or dont_spam_me_p = 'f');
</pre>
</blockquote>

The <code>users_alertable</code> view contains active users that 
wish to receive alerts:
<blockquote>
<pre>
create or replace view users_alertable
as
select * 
 from users 
 where (on_vacation_until is null or 
        on_vacation_until < sysdate)
 and user_state = 'authorized'
 and (email_bouncing_p is null or email_bouncing_p = 'f');
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li> Add options to force user to change password after x days.
