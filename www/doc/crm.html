<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

Publishers want to track a relationship with a customer over time by
classifying them by various metrics such as site activity or buying
activity. This module provides a way to specify states that a user may
be in, and a way to specify state transitions based on any metric
which can be expressed in SQL. This models the progression of a
relationship better than a static numeric worth value. These states
can then be used to target actions at particular classes of users.

<p>

An example: an e-commerce site might define the following states:
<ul>
<li>raw user: just registered, hasn't really done much yet
<li>good prospect: has bought one or more thing in the last month
<li>solid customer: has bought more than 3 things in the last month
<li>great customer: has bought more than 10 things in the last month
<li>slipping customer: formerly a solid or great customer, but has fallen
    under threshold in the past month
<li>dead user: has not done anything for the last three months
</ul>

<p>

The transitions might be
<ul>
<li>from raw user to good prospect or dead user
<li>from good prospect to solid customer or dead user
<li>from solid customer to great customer or slipping customer
<li>from great customer to slipping customer
<li>from slipping customer to dead user
<li>from dead user to good prospect
</ul>


<h3>Under the Hood</h3>

A user's current state and the date it was entered is stored as part of the
<code>users</code> table:

<blockquote>
<pre><code>
crm_state		varchar(50) references crm_states,
crm_state_entered_date	date, -- when the current state was entered
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

The allowable states are listed in
<blockquote>
<pre><code>
create table crm_states (
	state_name	varchar(50) not null primary key,
	description	varchar(1000) not null -- for UI
);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

Allowable state transitions are stored in
<blockquote>
<pre><code>
create table crm_state_transitions (
	state_name	not null references crm_states,
	next_state	not null references crm_states,
	triggering_order	integer not null,
	transition_condition	varchar(500) not null,
	primary key (state_name, next_state)
);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

The <code>transition_condition</code> field specifies a SQL fragment
which will get called as

<blockquote>
<pre><code>
update users
set user_state = **next_state**, crm_state_entered_date = sysdate
where user_state = **state_name**
and (**transition_condition**)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

Periodically (as defined by the parameter
<code>UpdatePeriodHours</code> in the [ns/server/servername/acs/crm]
section and defaulting to 24 hours), each
<code>transition_condition</code> fragment will be run as above, in
the order specified by <code>triggering_order</code>.
