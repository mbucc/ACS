</ul>

This is an API for programmers writing scripts in the ArsDigita
Community System that return documents (a degenerate form of which is a
Web page) to Web clients.

<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

Standard AOLserver programming, like CGI scripting before it, had the
programmer directly writing bytes to a client browser connection.  Thus
from 1995 through 2000 an AOLserver programmer would build up a complete
HTML page in a script and write the bytes of that page to the client
either all at once with <code>ns_return</code> or incrementally with
<code>ns_write</code>.

<p>

Problems with this standard old approach:

<ul>
<li>difficult to control style on a site-global basis via a master
template 

<li>difficult to write a script that returns an XML document that is
then rendered by a higher-level request processor (i.e., each individual
script has to be aware of all possible document types that might be
required by client, e.g., HTML, WML, XML, etc.)

<li>easy for novice programmer to create server performance problems by
calling API procedures that block in the TCP stack while holding a
database handle from the pool (i.e., a script could be waiting for a
client on a slow modem to accept some packets while holding a database
connection from a limited pool)

</ul>

<p>


As of ACS 3.3, new modules and scripts can be constructed to build
<i>documents</i> rather than <i>pages</i>. A document is a data
structure containing a <i>body</i> and a series of attached properties
(e.g., <i>title</i>). Once a document is built by a script, the request
processor takes over and renders the document into something which the
client can understand, e.g., an HTML page.

<h3>How To Use It, In Twenty-Five Words Or Less</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use <tt>doc_body_append</tt> instead of <tt>ns_write</tt>.
<li>Use <tt>doc_set_property</tt> to set the title and navbar.
<li>Don't write page headers or footers; leave that to the master template.
</ul>

<h3>Using the Document API: An Example</h3>

<h4>The Pre-3.3 Way: Writing to the Connection</h4>

Consider the following hypothetical old-style Tcl page
(call it <tt>user-list</tt>) that writes out a list of names
of registered users:

<blockquote><pre>
ReturnHeaders "text/html"

ns_write "[ad_header "User List"]
&lt;h2>User List&lt;/h2>

[ad_context_bar_ws [list "index" "Users"] "User List"]
&lt;hr>

&lt;ul>
"

set user_list ""

set selection [ns_db select $db "
    select first_names, last_name from users order by upper(last_name)
"]
while { [ns_db getrow $db $selection] } {
    set_variables_after_query
    append user_list "&lt;li>$first_names $last_name\n"
}
ns_db releasehandle

ns_write "$user_list&lt;/ul>

&lt;hr>
[ad_footer]
"
</blockquote></pre>

This is all well and good, but what if we decided we wanted to make that title appear
in a sans-serif font on every page in the site, and have the context bar appear in
a right-aligned table next the body, and eliminate the <tt>&lt;hr></tt>s as well? We couldn't,
without manually fixing every single <tt></tt> file (or having Jin write a Perl script).

<h4>The Enlightened Way: Building a Document</h4>

<p>For reasons like this it's a good idea to
break each page into a set of separate pieces which a master template can piece
together however it sees fit. For HTML pages in general, we identify three pieces of
information we can split up easily:

<ul>
<li>The page's title.
<li>The navigational bar.
<li>The body of the page (everything between the <tt>&lt;hr&gt;</tt>s).
</ul>

The document API allows us to output these pieces separately. <tt>user-list</tt> becomes:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>doc_set_property</b> title "User List"
<b>doc_set_property</b> navbar [list [list "index" "Users"] "User List"]

<b>doc_body_append</b> "&lt;ul>\n"


set selection [ns_db select $db "
    select first_names, last_name from users order by upper(last_name)
"]
while { [ns_db getrow $db $selection] } {
    set_variables_after_query
    <b>doc_body_append</b> "&lt;li>$first_names $last_name\n"
}

<b>doc_body_append</b> "&lt;/ul>\n"

# we can release the db handle anywhere in the script now; nothing
# gets written to the client until we return (or unless 
# doc_body_flush is called)
ns_db releasehandle


</pre></blockquote>

None of this actually writes to the connection. It calls a few magical
APIs, <tt>doc_set_mime_type</tt>, <tt>doc_set_property</tt>,
and <tt>doc_body_append</tt>, which construct a data structure. This data structure
is then passed by the request processor
to an ADP <i>master template</i> (usually called <tt>master.adp</tt>),
which might look like:

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;html>
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>&lt;%= $title %>&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body bgcolor=white>
    &lt;h2>&lt;%= $title %>&lt;/h2>
    <%= [eval ad_context_bar_ws $navbar] %>
  &lt;hr>
    &lt;%= $body %>
  &lt;hr>
    &lt;address>jsalz@mit.edu&lt;/address>
&lt;/html>
</pre></blockquote>

Note that to refer to the document properties (title, navbar) we just use the usual
ADP syntax for reading variables, e.g., <tt>&lt;%= $title %></tt> to read the <tt>title</tt>
property. The same goes for the document body, which is read with <tt>&lt;%= $body %></tt>.

The request processor locates the appropriate master template for a page as follows:

<ul>

<li>In the directory containing the file being delivered (e.g., <tt>user-list</tt>),
look for a file called <tt>master.adp</tt>. If there's one there, use it. If not:
<li>Look for <tt>master.adp</tt> in the parent directory of that directory. Keep traversing
up the directory tree until a file called <tt>master.adp</tt> is found.

<li>If no <tt>master.adp</tt> file is found anywhere in the main
code tree, use the <tt>master.adp</tt>
file in the <tt>templates</tt> directory (the site-wide default master template).
</ul>

For example, if <tt>user-list</tt> is really <tt>/web/arsdigita/www/users/user-list</tt>,
we'll check for a master template at

<ul>
  <li><tt>/web/arsdigita/www/users/master.adp</tt>
  <li><tt>/web/arsdigita/www/master.adp</tt>
  <li><tt>/web/arsdigita/templates/master.adp</tt>
</ul>

This allows us to provide a default master template, but to override it for documents
in specific parts of the site.

<h3><a name=adp>ADPs as Documents</a></h3>

You can also build a document in an ADP file, by enclosing the
body in <tt>&lt;ad-document&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;/ad-document&gt;</tt>, and
using the &lt;ad-property&gt; tag to set properties.
The following ADP file (<tt>user-list.adp</tt>) is equivalent
to <tt>user-list.tcl</tt> above:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>&lt;ad-document></b>
  <b>&lt;ad-property name=title></b>User List<b>&lt;/ad-property></b>
  <b>&lt;ad-property name=navbar></b>[list [list "index" "Users"] "User List"]<b>&lt;/ad-property></b>

  &lt;ul>

&lt;%

set selection [ns_db select $db "
    select first_names, last_name from users order by upper(last_name)
"]
while { [ns_db getrow $db $selection] } {
    set_variables_after_query
    <b>ns_adp_puts</b> "&lt;li>$first_names $last_name"
}
ns_db releasehandle
%>

  &lt;/ul>
<b>&lt;/ad-document></b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Complete Tcl API</h3>

<dl>
<dt><tt>doc_set_mime_type <i>mime-type</i></tt>
<dd>Sets the MIME type for the current document to <i>mime-type</i>. This defaults to
<tt>text/html;content-pane</tt> (which means that we should try to apply a master template),
so you probably won't need to change it in most cases. In the rare case that you do need to
write a page which shouldn't be generated through the master template (e.g., a differently
formatted HTML page, or a <tt>text/plain</tt> page), you'd use this procedure, e.g.,

<blockquote><pre>doc_set_mime_type "text/html"</pre></blockquote>

or

<blockquote><pre>doc_set_mime_type "text/plain"</pre></blockquote>

Then you'd use <tt>doc_body_append</tt> to generate your document, and the request processor
would just serve your document as is.

</p>

<dt><tt>doc_set_property <i>name</i> <i>value</i></tt><br>
<dd>Sets the document-level property named <i>name</i> to <i>value</i>.
</p>

<dt><tt>doc_body_append <i>string</i></tt>
<dd>Appends <i>string</i> to the document body.
</p>

<dt><tt>doc_body_flush <i>string</i></tt>

<dd>Writes out as much as possible to the client.  This is a dangerous
API call because the programmer runs the risk of tying up a database
handle if he or she is not thoughtful.  Does nothing if the mime type
has not been set.  Does nothing if the document being produced must be
rendered via a master template.

</dl>

<h3>What's the Point?</h3>

Many more interesting and important things (which we'll add for ACS 4.0) fit into this framework:

<ul>

<li>By adding
datasources (really just single- or multi-row properties) we'll be able to generate documents
programatically which are semantically equivalent to <tt>.spec</tt> files in
<a href="http://karl.arsdigita.com/projects/template/doc/">Karl Goldstein's templating system</a>
(but generated with a Tcl API).
</p>

<li>More specific types of data (e.g., ASJ articles, bulletin board topics, and even individual items in
topics) will turn into documents which are individually templatized (allowing us complete
separation of data and presentation).
</p>

<li>The request processor will have a set of rules allowing it to automatically determine
which components to invoke based on document types and request headers (e.g., user agent) so we
can dynamically serve the right form of data for a particular client.

</ul>

This API is part of a gradual move toward this model.

<h3>Under the Hood</h3>

<p>The <tt>doc_*</tt> API calls store stuff in a global variable named <tt>doc_properties</tt>.
After the abstract URL system sources a <tt></tt> file, it checks to see if anything's been
set in <tt>doc_properties</tt>. If so, it analyzes the MIME type in the document that's been
returned, and invokes a template or returns the body, as appropriate. If not, it assumes the page did its own
<tt>ns_write</tt> or <tt>ns_return</tt>ing (and doesn't do anything special).
