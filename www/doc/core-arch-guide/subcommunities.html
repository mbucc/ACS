<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

Most online communites actually become collections of discrete
subcommunities. For example, a corporate intranet/extranet serves both
units within the company (e.g., offices, departments, teams, projects)
and external parties (e.g., customers, partners, vendors). The ACS
enables you to provide each subcommunity with its own "virtual
website" or <em>subsite</em>, by assembling <a
href="packages">modules</a> that together deliver a feature set
tailored to the needs of the subcommunity.

<p>

A user can be a member of more than one subcommunity (an employee is
located at an office, works on one or more projects, and is a member
of a team, within a department), so subsites provide an intuitive
partitioning of information (to find out when a project is scheduled
to launch, go to the project subsite; to learn about benefits, go to
the HR department subsite; etc), improving the usability of the site
as a whole.

<p>

This does <em>not</em> imply that navigating subsites is the only way
for users to get information from subcommunities. Rather, the ACS will
also provide a <em>user-centric</em> portal (along the lines of <a
href="http://my.yahoo.com/">My Yahoo!</a>) that integrates relevant
content from all subcommunities to which the user belongs. The real
challenge is figuring out what is actually relevant to the user; doing
this is what's known, in industry terms, as
<em>personalization</em>. (<a href="new-stuff">New Stuff</a> is a
simple example of personalization, based on the assumption that most
users will be interested in new content.) <a
href="user-profiling">User profiling</a> provides the foundation for
really effective personalization.

<p>

In practice, "subcommunity" is simply a fancy name for "user group."
Accordingly, we use the <a href="/doc/user-groups">user groups</a>
data model to represent subcommunities.

<h3>Site Specifications</h3>

A <strong>site specification</strong> is simply a collection of
modules that together comprise <em>either</em> an initial template for
subsites <em>or</em> the actual definition of a subsite.

<p>

For each type of subcommunity (i.e., <code>user_group_type</code>),
you can define a site specification, to designate modules that you
believe any subcommunity of that type will find useful. For example,
to build a family collaboration service along the lines of <a
href="http://www.myfamily.com/">MyFamily.com</a>, you (as the site
administrator) would:

<ol>

<li>Define a "Family" <code>user_group_type</code>

<li>Construct a site specification for families by choosing from the
menu of available modules, perhaps selecting

<a href="/doc/bboard">Discussion Forums</a>,
<a href="/doc/chat">Chat</a>,
<a href="/doc/calendar">Calendar</a>,
<a href="/doc/address-book">Address Book</a>,
<a href="/doc/file-storage">File Storage</a>,
<a href="/doc/bookmarks">Bookmarks</a>,
<a href="/doc/photodb">Photo DB</a>, and
<a href="/doc/webmail">Webmail</a>

</ol>

To build an ecommerce ASP (application service provider) like <a
href="http://store.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Store</a> or <a
href="http://zshops.amazon.com/">Amazon.com zShops</a>, you would:

<ol>

<li>Define a "Merchant" <code>user_group_type</code>

<li>Construct a site specification for merchants, selecting
<a href="/doc/ecommerce">Ecommerce</a> only

</ol>

<p>

The data model for site specifications consists of two simple tables:

<blockquote>
<code><pre>
create table ad_site_specifications (
        site_spec_id    integer not null
                        constraint ad_site_specs_pk
                        primary key,
        on_which_table  varchar(30) not null,
        on_what_id      varchar(30)
        constraint ad_site_specs_uk
        unique (on_which_table, on_what_id)
);

-- on_what_id is not numeric because the primary key of the
-- user_group_types table (the group_type column) is a varchar;
-- should we add a numeric primary key to user_group_types? ugh.

create table ad_site_spec_modules (
        site_spec_id    not null
                        constraint ad_site_spec_mods_spec_id_fk
                        references ad_site_specifications (site_spec_id),
        module_key      not null
                        constraint ad_site_spec_mods_mod_key_fk
                        references acs_modules (module_key),
        constraint ad_site_spec_mods_pk
        primary key (site_spec_id, module_key)
);

-- We may want to add audit trails for these tables

-- Note: The above tables supersede the existing
-- <code>user_group_type_module_map</code> table
</pre></code>
</blockquote>

To define a site specification for a given
<code>user_group_type</code> like "Family" or "Merchant", we insert a
row into <code>ad_site_specifications</code> with "user_group_types"
as the value of the <code>on_which_table</code> column and the
appropriate <code>group_type</code> in the <code>on_what_id</code>
column.

<h3>Subsites</h3>

When a subcommunity (<code>user_group</code>) is created, a
corresponding subsite will be created automatically if a site
specification exists for that type of subcommunity
(<code>user_group_type</code>). The modules designated by the
specification are installed in the subsite and made available for
immediate use. This is what we mean by saying that a site
specification can function as an initial template for subsites
("initial" in the sense that subsite administrators can remove
default modules and/or add new ones).

<p>

Subsites themselves are also represented as site specifications. For
example, a "Merchant" subsite would be created by copying the site
specification for the "Merchant" <code>user_group_type</code>,
resulting in another row in the <code>ad_site_specifications</code>
table (with "user_groups" as the value of <code>on_which_table</code>
and the appropriate <code>group_id</code> as the value of
<code>on_what_id</code>) and all the corresponding child rows in
<code>ad_site_spec_modules</code>.

<p>

One important issue to consider is <em>change propagation</em>, i.e.,
what, if anything, happens to a subsite (<code>user_group</code> site
spec) when its template (<code>user_group_type</code> site spec) is
modified, e.g., a module is added or removed. The simplest model is to
have subsites branch irrevocably from their templates upon creation,
so that <em>no changes</em> made to templates are ever propagated to
subsites. This is what the ACS implements.

<p>

A more sophisticated and complex change propagation model, which the
ACS does <em>not</em> implement, is presented below, in <a
href="#change_propagation">Appendix B</a>.

<h4>Special Cases</h4>

We treat the site-wide community as a degenerate case of subcommunity,
represented by the predefined "all_users" user group and corresponding
subsite. In this way, modules can be installed for the site as a
whole, just as they are for subsites.

<p>

On the opposite extreme, another degenerate case is the subcommunity
of one, i.e., the individual user. By allowing for <em>personal
subsites</em>, we can use standard modules to provide a <a
href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a>-like suite of integrated
services:

<blockquote>
<table>

<tr>
<td><a href="/doc/calendar">Calendar</a></td>
<td>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</td>
<td><a href="http://calendar.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Calendar</a></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a href="/doc/address-book">Address Book</a></td>
<td>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</td>
<td><a href="http://address.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Address Book</a></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a href="/doc/webmail">Webmail</a></td>
<td>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</td>
<td><a href="http://mail.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Mail</a></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Publishing</td>
<td>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</td>
<td><a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! GeoCities</a></td>
</tr>

</table>
</blockquote>

Personal subsites are represented by rows in the
<code>ad_site_specifications</code> table, with "users" as the value
of <code>on_which_table</code> and the appropriate
<code>user_id</code> as the value of <code>on_what_id</code>.

<p>

A predefined site specification (with an <code>on_which_table</code>
value of "users" and an <code>on_what_id</code> value of
<code>null</code>) is used as the template for all personal
subsites.

<p>

Finally, not all modules make sense in the context of a personal
subsite (e.g., "information pushing" services like News and
collaborative services like Chat or Discussion Forums), so the Package
Management metadata for each module should explicitly state whether or
not it can be used in a personal subsite.

<!-- "members" instead of "users"; admin access is assumed -->

<h4>Subsite Administration</h4>

Overall responsibility for adminstration of each subsite belongs to
<em>either</em> users in the "administrator" role for the
corresponding user group <em>or</em>, in the case of personal
subsites, the owning user. We represent this responsibility with a
<code>general_permissions</code> row granting "administer" permission
on the appropriate row in the <code>ad_site_specifications</code>
table.

<p>

Responsibility can be delegated at either the subsite level (by
granting the "administrator" role to other group members) or the
module level (by inserting <code>general_permissions</code> rows
granting "administer" permission on the appropriate row in the
<code>ad_site_spec_modules</code> table).

<p>

(One implication of this model is that we could decide to replace the
predefined Site-Wide Administration group with the "administrator"
role of the <code>all_users</code> site spec. Practically speaking,
this might prove challenging.)

<p>

(Also, this model does not make sense with personal subsites, where
the user experience should be seamless, whether performing what are
normally considered "administrative" actions or regular end-user
actions.)

<h4>Subsite URLs</h4>

The URL of an ACS subsite consists of two parts:

<ol>

<li>the hostname

<li>the subsite's "page root" (i.e., the path under which all pages in
the subsite appear)

</ol>

By default, the latter part (the subsite page root) is:

<blockquote>
<code>/<i>&lt;group_type_plural&gt;</i>/<i>&lt;group_name&gt;</i>/</code>
</blockquote>

with subsite-wide administration pages at:

<blockquote>
<code>/<i>&lt;group_type_plural&gt;</i>/<i>&lt;group_name&gt;</i>/admin/</code>
</blockquote>

The path for a given subsite module is:

<blockquote>
<code>/<i>&lt;group_type_plural&gt;</i>/<i>&lt;group_name&gt;</i>/<i>&lt;module_url_stub&gt;</i>/</code>
</blockquote>

with module-level administration pages at:

<blockquote>
<code>/<i>&lt;group_type_plural&gt;</i>/<i>&lt;group_name&gt;</i>/<i>&lt;module_url_stub&gt;</i>/admin/</code>
</blockquote>

So, for instance, the URL for the Boston office's subsite on our
hypothetical corporate website would be:

<blockquote>
<code>http://www.company.com/offices/boston/</code>
</blockquote>

and news specific to the Boston office would be found at:

<blockquote>
<code>http://www.company.com/offices/boston/news/</code>
</blockquote>

<p>

Since the virtual directories that correspond to
<code>user_group_types</code> appear directly under the actual page
root, there is the possibility of name collision with directories in
the filesystem. To address this, we log an error for each collision
detected when the server starts (which <a
href="http://www.arsdigita.com/free-tools/watchdog">Watchdog</a> will
then report to the site administrators) and give precedence to the
real directories.

<!--

Also, we make the virtual subcommunity directories always available
under <code>/groups/</code>.

Primary subcommunity type

-->

<p>

The aforementioned special cases of the public site and personal
subsites are handled differently:

<p>

The public site is served from directly under the page
root. Continuing our example from above, company-wide news would
appear at:

<blockquote>
<code>http://www.company.com/news/</code>
</blockquote>

<p>

As for personal subsites, their URLs take the form:

<blockquote>
<code>/users/<i>&lt;user_id&gt;</i>/</code>
</blockquote>

or (if the user has chosen a screen name):

<blockquote>
<code>/users/<i>&lt;screen_name&gt;</i>/</code>
</blockquote>

(<font color=red>Should we also support
<code>/users/<i>&lt;email_address&gt;</i>/</code>?</font>)

<h3>Under the Hood</h3>

Clearly, the Subcommunities architecture has both design and
implementation implications for the rest of ACS. Now, every page must
ask the question, "Where (i.e., in which subsite) is the user?" For
each page request, the answer to this question is key to providing the
appropriate response. For example, a visitor to <code>/news/</code>
should be served only public news (i.e., news items for the
<code>all_users</code> pseudo-subcommunity), while a visitor to
<code>/offices/boston/news/</code> should be served only news items
specific to the Boston office subcommunity.

<p>

In order to make this work, we need to be able to relate entities to
their enclosing subcommunities, which should be a straightforward
process:

<ol>

<li>Add a foreign key column that references
<code>ad_site_specifications</code> in each "top-level" table (i.e.,
tables that do not already have a parent table, such as
<code>bboard_topics</code>).

<li>On each page, use the <code>ad_conn</code> API (to be determined)
to identify the enclosing subcommunity.

<li>Include the corresponding <code>site_spec_id</code> as a criterion
in any query against the top-level table(s).
</ol>

For example, by default, the <a href="ticket">Ticket Tracker</a> index
page presents a full listing of tickets assigned to the logged-in
user. This page will be enhanced to filter out any tickets that do not
belong in the subcommunity identified by the "virtual page root"
portion of the URL: "<code>/</code>" for the <code>all_users</code>
subcommunity, "<code>/users/123</code>" for the personal subsite of
user #123, etc.

<p>

<h4>Sharing Data Between Subcommunities</h4>

While there are some communities where data will rarely, if ever,
cross subcommunity boundaries (e.g., our hypothetical ecommerce ASP,
in which each subcommunity is an independent merchant), many others do
need to share data between subcommunities.

<p>

For instance, an employee's contact information should be available
both in the company directory (i.e., <a href="address-book">Address
Book</a>) and (at least, in part) on the subsites of her project(s),
for access by the customer. Another example is <a
href="calendar">Calendar</a>: calendar events should "cascade" down,
so that an employee's calendar is comprised of events from every level
up the organizational hierarchy.

<p>

If we make the simplifying assumption that each entity has one and
only one owner, what remains is to establish a many-to-one (instead of
one-to-one) relationship between subsite and entity, so that, for
instance, an address book entry "owned" by the company-wide directory
(<code>all_users</code> subcommunity) would be viewable in the context
of other subsites. We can do this generically with a table like:

<blockquote>
<code><pre>
TBD...
<!--
create table ad_subsite_map (
        ...
        site_spec_id        constraint ad_site_specs_parent_spec_id_fk
                            references ad_site_specifications (site_spec_id)
);
-->
</pre></code>
</blockquote>

<h3>Appendix A: Hierarchical Subcommunities</h3>

In reality, many communities contain not one but many levels of
subcommunity that together comprise a hierarchy. For instance, at
ArsDigita, the Operations department consists of teams, each of which
is responsible for multiple projects. It makes sense to represent
"department", "team", and "project" as <code>user_group_types</code>.

<p>

The current definition of the <code>user_groups</code> includes a
<code>parent_group_id</code> that allows us to establish these
hierarchical relationships between actual user groups, but does not
address two separate but related needs:

<ol>

<li>Relationships other than a singular parent-child relationship,
e.g., there are multiple parties involved in an ArsDigita project: the
team, the customer, potentially one or more partners (graphic design
firms, etc.). In the context of our intranet/extranet, each of these
parties is a <code>user_group</code>, and the project itself is a
<code>user_group</code>. The <code>parent_group_id</code> column alone
is not enough to represent all of these relationships, so the current
data model would force us to extend the automatically-generated
<code>project_info</code> data model, e.g.:

<blockquote>
<code><pre>
create table project_info (
        ...
        customer_id     not null
                        constraint project_info_customer_id_fk
                        references customer_info (group_id)
);

create table project_partner_map (
        project_id      not null
                        constraint proj_partner_map_project_id_fk
                        references project_info (group_id),
        partner_id      not null
                        constraint proj_partner_map_partner_id_fk
                        references partner_info (group_id),
);
</pre></code>
</blockquote>

There is no reason that these relationships cannot be stored
generically, just as all manner of user-to-user-group relationships
are stored in the <code>user_group_map</code> table. We accomplish by
introducing a new table, <code>user_group_relationships</code> (<font
color=red>better name?</font>):

<blockquote>
<code><pre>
create table user_group_relationships (
        <em>insert two group_id columns and a descriptor
        for the relationship here</em>
);
</pre></code>
</blockquote>

<p>

<li>Relationships exist not at only the <code>user_groups</code> but
also at the <code>user_group_types</code> level. Our data model should
be able to express business rules like "every project must be assigned
to a team" and "every department must belong a company":

<blockquote>
<code><pre>
create table user_group_type_relationships (
        <em>insert two group_type columns and a descriptor
        for the relationship here</em>
);
</pre></code>
</blockquote>

</ol>

Extending our data model to address these two needs has a number of
implications.

<p>

First, the <code>user_groups</code> uniqueness constraint would change
from just <code>short_name</code> to <code>short_name</code>
<em>and</em> <code>parent_group_id</code>. Thus, each node in the
subcommunity hierarchy becomes its own namespace, like directories in
a filesystem, instead of the single flat namespace for user groups
that exists today.

<p>

Secondly, it would probably make sense for subsite URLs to reflect the
subcommunity hierarchy. For example, consider an outsourced intranet
service where <code>company</code> is the top-level subcommunity.
Multiple companies might have offices in Boston, and the subsites for
those offices should be located at unambiguous URL paths such as:

<blockquote>
<code>/arsdigita/boston/</code>
</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>
<code>/greylock/boston/</code>
</blockquote>

<a name="change_propagation"><h3>Appendix B: Change Propagation</h3></a>

Maintaining a "live link" between the <code>user_group_type</code>
site spec and its children makes it possible to do nice things like
add a new module at the <code>user_group_type</code> level and have it
become instantly available to all subcommunities of that type. The
price is the extra complexity of handling situations like: a module is
removed from the <code>user_group_type</code> site spec; what happens
to all the dependent <code>user_group</code> site specs?

<p>

To support this model of change propagation, we would probably add
more columns to <code>ad_site_specifications</code>, e.g.:

<blockquote>
<code><pre>
create table ad_site_specifications (
        ...
        parent_spec_id      constraint ad_site_specs_parent_spec_id_fk
                            references ad_site_specifications (site_spec_id),
        sync_with_parent_p  char(1) not null
                            constraint ad_site_spec_sync_w_parent_p_cc
                            check (sync_with_parent_p in ('t', 'f'))
);
</pre></code>
</blockquote>

Of course, there would also need to be code and user interface to
handle conflict cases like the module removal scenario above.

<font color=green>
<h3>API</h3>

<ul>
<li>user group definition (already exists, so probably just needs clean-up)
<li><code>ad_site_spec_copy(source_spec_id, on_which_table, on_what_id)</code>
<li><code>all_users_group_id()</code>
<li><code>all_users_site_spec_id()</code>
<li><code>personal_subsite_spec_id()</code>
</ul>
