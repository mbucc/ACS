This is a really simple address book which also does birthday
reminders.  Although the RemindMe service does birthday reminders
beautifully, I find it convenient to have the birthdays along with 
the other information about people in my address book, so I might
as well send out the reminders with this module instead of making
the user key the birthday information both here and in RemindMe.

<p>

This module, which contains nothing remotely fancy, has lots of
room for improvement, for instance, categorization of people 
(personal vs. business) or other ways of browsing records.  It also
should have ways to share records in the standard ACS way:  public,
group, and private ownership.
