<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

When you have more than one person updating information in a table, you
want to record all the values of a row over time.  This package gives
you (1) a standard way of naming tables and triggers in Oracle, (2) two
Tcl procedures (<code>ad_audit_trail</code> and 
<code>ad_audit_trail_for_table</code>) that helps you display the old 
values of a row, including highlighting particular changed columns, (3)
a Tcl procedure (<code>ad_audit_delete_row</code>) that simplifies the
logging of a deleted row, and (4) an example user interface (
<code>audit-tables</code>, <code>audit-table</code>, <code>audit</code>) to retrieve and display audit histories.

<h3>Steps for Auditing a Table</h3>

We record old information in a separate audit table (see 
<a href="http://photo.net/sql/triggers">the triggers chapter of 
<cite>SQL for Web Nerds</cite></a> for more explanation of this idea).

<p>

We distinguish between the on-line transaction processing (OLTP) tables
that are used in the minute-by-minute operation of the server and the
audit tables.

<p>

Here are the steps to add audit trails:

<ul>

<li>Decide which OLTP tables need auditing. Three fields must be added to
each OLTP table to save information about who was making changes, what
IP address they were using, and the date they made the changes.

<blockquote>
<pre>
create table ec_products (
        product_id              integer not null primary key,
        product_name            varchar(200),
        one_line_description    varchar(400),

        ...

        -- the user ID and IP address of the last modifier of the product
<font color=red>        last_modified           date not null,
        last_modifying_user     not null references users,
        modified_ip_address     varchar(20) not null</font>
);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<li>Create one audit table for each OLTP table that is being audited.
By convention, this table should be named by adding an "_audit" suffix
to the OLTP table name.
The audit table has all the columns of the main table, with the same
data types but no integrity constraints.  Also add a flag to indicate
that an audit entry is for a deleted row in the OLTP table.

<blockquote>
<pre>
create table ec_products<font color=red>_audit</font> as
   select * from ec_products where 1 = 0;

alter table ec_products<font color=red>_audit</font> add (
        delete_p    char(1) default('f') check (delete_p in ('t','f'))
);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<li>Add one update trigger for each OLTP table.
<blockquote>
<pre>
create or replace trigger ec_products_audit_tr
before update or delete on ec_products
for each row
begin
        insert into ec_products_audit (
        product_id, product_name, 
        one_line_description, 

        ...

        last_modified,
        last_modifying_user, modified_ip_address
        ) values (
        :old.product_id, :old.product_name, 
        :old.one_line_description, 

        ...

        :old.last_modified,
        :old.last_modifying_user, :old.modified_ip_address
        );
end;
/
show errors
</pre>
</blockquote>

Note that it is not possible to automatically populate the audit table on
deletion because we need the IP address of the deleting user.

<li>Change any  script that deletes rows from an audited table.  It
should call <code>ad_audit_delete_row</code> with args key list, column 
name list, and audit_table_name. This procedure calls 
<code>ad_get_user_id</code> and <code>ns_conn peeraddr</code> and records
the user_id and IP address of the user deleting the row.

<blockquote>
<pre><code>
db_transaction {
db_dml unused "delete from ec_products where product_id=$product_id"
ad_audit_delete_row [list $product_id] [list product_id] ec_products_audit
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<li>Insert a call to <code>ad_audit_trail</code> in an admin page to
show the changes made to a key. Insert a call to <code>ad_audit_trail_for_table</code> to show the changes made to an entire table over a specified period of time.

<li> <em>optionally</em> define two views to provide "user friendly"
audits.  Look at the 
<a href="/doc/sql/display-sql?url=/doc/sql/ticket.sql">ticket
tracker data model</a> tables <code>ticket_pretty</code> and
<code>ticket_pretty_audit</code> for an example.  This has the
benefit of decoding the meaningless integer ID's and highlighting potential data 
integrity violations.
</ul>

<h3>Reference</h3>

Audit columns:

<ul>
<li><b>last_modified</b> The date the row was last changed.
<li><b>last_modifying_user</b> The ID of the user who last changed the row.
<li><b>modified_ip_address</b> The IP Address the change request came from.
<li><b>delete_p</b> The true/false tag that indicates the audit table entry is recording information on the user who deleted a row.
</ul>

Arguments for 
<a href="proc-one?proc_name=ad_audit_trail_for_table"><code>ad_audit_trail_for_table</code></a>

<ul>

Returns an audit trail across an entire table, (multiple keys).
<p>

<li><b>db</b> Database handle.
<li><b>main_table_name</b> Table that holds the main record. If sent an empty string as main_table_name, ad_audit_trail assumes that the audit_table_name has all current records.
<li><b>audit_table_name</b> Table that holds the audit records.
<li><b>id_column</b> Column name of the primary key in audit_table_name and main_table_name.
<li><b>start_date</b> (optional) ANSI standard time to begin viewing records.
<li><b>end_date</b> (optional) ANSI standard time to stop viewing records.
<li><b>audit_url</b> (optional) URL of a tcl page that would display the full audit history of an record. Form variables for that page: id id_column main_table_name and audit_table_name.
<li><b>restore_url</b> (optional) (future improvement) <i>URL of a tcl page that would restore a given record to the main table. Form variables for the page: id id_column main_table_name audit_table_name and rowid.</i>

</ul>

Arguments for 
<a href="proc-one?proc_name=ad_audit_trail"><code>ad_audit_trail</code></a>

<ul>

Returns an audit trail of a single key in a table.
<p>

<li><b>db</b> Database handle.
<li><b>id_list</b> List of ids representing the unique record you are processing.
<li><b>audit_table_name</b> Table that holds the audit records.
<li><b>main_table_name</b> Table that holds the main record. If sent an empty string as main_table_name, ad_audit_trail assumes that the audit_table_name has all current records.
<li><b>id_column_list</b> Column names of the unique key in audit_table_name and main_table_name.
<li><b>columns_not_reported</b> (optional)
Tcl list of column names in audit_table_name and main_table
 that you don't want displayed.
<li><b>start_date</b> (optional) ANSI standard time to begin viewing records.
<li><b>end_date</b> (optional) ANSI standard time to stop viewing records.
<li><b>restore_url</b> (optional) (future improvement)<i>URL of a tcl page that would restore a given record to the main table. Form variables for the page:  id id_column main_table_name audit_table_name and rowid.</i>

</ul>

Arguments for <a href="proc-one?proc_name=ad_audit_delete_row"><code>ad_audit_delete_row</code></a>

<ul>

Creates a row in the audit table to log when, who, and from what IP address a row was deleted.
<p>

<li><b>db</b> Database handle.
<li><b>id_list</b> Tcl list of the ids specifying the unique record you are processing. (Or the list of ID's in the case of a map table.)
<li><b>id_column_list</b> Tcl list of the column names of the unique key in audit_table_name.
<li><b>audit_table_name</b> Table that holds the audit records.


</ul>

<h3>Future Improvements</h3>

The ad_audit_trail and ad_audit_trail_for_table procedures could be extended to restore previous values. The restore_url would be a pointer to a script that could restore an old row to the main table. The script would need to query the data dictionary for the columns of the audit and main tables. It might also require the user to confirm if a current record would be overwritten by the restore option.
