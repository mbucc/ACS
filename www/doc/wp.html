<h3>History</h3>

WimpyPoint was born as a standalone application, started by Philip Greenspun
in late December, 1997 and later enhanced by Krish Menon. WimpyPoint was 
rewritten by Jon Salz and reborn as an ACS module in late 1999, as
a term project for MIT's <a href="http://6916.lcs.mit.edu">6.916: Software Engineering of Innovative Web Services</a> class.

<p>For more general information, see
the <a href="/help/for-one-page?url=%2fwp%2findex%2etcl">the user-level help pages</a>.

<h3>Data Model</h3>

<h4>Styles</h4>

The standalone WimpyPoint provided only limited style support: it allowed users to select
from a limited set of CSS style sheets to associate with each presentation. Users can now
maintain their own repositories of styles. Each style is a row in the <tt>wp_styles</tt>
table. Users can provide colors (stored in table columns in the form <tt>192,192,255</tt>)
and optionally background image.

<p>A style can be marked public, meaning that every user can view it. (For instance,
the "Default (Plain)" style is public.) The UI does not provide any mechanism for
styles to be marked public (administrators should just use SQL*Plus to change <tt>public_p</tt>).

<p>Note that the <tt>wp_styles</tt> and <tt>wp_style_images</tt> tables are interdependent,
so if you wanted to drop either table you'd need to use the <tt>CASCADE CONSTRAINTS</tt>
option to <tt>DROP TABLE</tt>.

<p>The style mechanism has much more general applicability than just to WimpyPoint - it
might be useful in the future to abstract this out somehow to provide cross-module style-editing
support.

<h4>Versioning</h4>

The data model is complicated significantly by versioning support,
which allows the owner of a presentation to freeze the slide set (and
later view previous versions, or revert to them). Each presentation
is associated with a nonempty set of "checkpoints," each a row in the
<tt>wp_checkpoints</tt> table.
Each slide is associated with the range of checkpoints
<tt>[min_checkpoint, max_checkpoint)</tt> in <tt>wp_slides</tt> (a <tt>max_checkpoint</tt>
of <tt>NULL</tt> corresponds to infinity, i.e., the latest version).

<p>In general, when a slide is edited and hasn't been changed
since the latest checkpoint, we make a new copy of the slide and fiddle
with the <tt>(min|max)_checkpoint</tt> of the old and new slide; when a slide is deleted,
we just set <tt>max_checkpoint</tt> to the current checkpoint (so it becomes
invisible in the most recent "view"). See <tt>slide-edit-2</tt> and
<tt>slide-delete-2</tt> for examples.

<p>When a slide set is frozen, we preserve the sorted order of the slides
in <tt>wp_historical_sort</tt>. Without this facility, in order to maintain
the versioning abstraction, whenever a user reordered slides
in a versioned presentation we'd have to recopy all the slides (defeating
the incremental nature of our versioning implementation).

<p>The <tt>wp_(previous|next)_slide</tt> functions determine
the slide before/after a particular slide when viewing the slide set at
a particular checkpoint (a <tt>v_checkpoint</tt> of <tt>NULL</tt>) corresponds
to the latest version).

<p><tt>wp_set_checkpoint</tt> and <tt>wp_revert_to_checkpoint</tt> do pretty
much what you'd think.

<h4>Access Control</h4>

Access control is handled using ACS groups. The <tt>wp_access</tt> function
determines, given a user's ID (or <tt>NULL</tt> for an anonymous user and
some fields from <tt>wp_presentations</tt>, what privileges the user has
with respect to the presentation.

<h3>Tcl Definitions</h3>

This was a term project, so I (<a href="mailto:jsalz@mit.edu">Jon</a>) was
eager to do something interesting from an engineering standpoint,
and went maybe a little overboard with
the abstractions involved. I don't think these are bad abstractions per se -
they consolidate code which, while taking 6.916, I found myself writing over and over -
but in retrospect maybe using abstraction so heavily is not The ACS Way(tm).

<ul>
<li><tt><b>wp_select</b></tt>, a control structure, takes the
place of the usual <tt>ns_db select</tt>/<tt>ns_db getrow</tt>/<tt>set_variables_after_query</tt>
loop. You can do:

<blockquote><pre>wp_select "select foo, bar from whatever" {
    ns_write "&lt;li&gt;$foo, $bar\n"
} else {
    ns_write "&lt;li&gt;nothing selected\n"
}</pre></blockquote>

<li><tt><b>wp_prepare_dml</b></tt>, given a table name, and names and values of columns, prepares
an <tt>UPDATE</tt> or <tt>INSERT</tt> statement. In general, this facilitates the consolidation
of pages which add records and edit existing records (e.g., <tt>slide-edit-2</tt> and
<tt>slide-add-2</tt> are wrapped into <tt>slide-add</tt>). This is useful since
<tt>-add</tt> and <tt>-edit</tt> pages often have to do the same kind of input validation
anyway.

<li><tt><b>wp_clob_dml</b></tt> applies an <tt>INSERT</tt> or <tt>UPDATE</tt> DML statement (such as that prepared by
<tt>wp_prepare_dml</tt>), optionally with up to three CLOBs provided in a list.

<li><tt><b>wp_try_dml</b></tt> and <tt><b>wp_try_dml_or_break</b></tt> try to execute a <tt>DML</tt> statement
but generate an appropriate error message if it fails. (<tt>wp_try_dml_or_break</tt> additionally does a
<tt>return -code return</tt> in this case.)

<li><tt><b>wp_only_if</b></tt> returns certain text if a condition is true, else other text.
This is useful for embedding in long strings, e.g.:

<blockquote><pre>ns_write "
... stuff ...

&lt;option [wp_only_if { $id == 1 } "selected"]&gt;Nummer Eins
&lt;option [wp_only_if { $id == 2 } "selected"]&gt;Nummer Zwei

... more stuff ...
"</pre></blockquote>

<li><tt><b>wp_header</b></tt>, given an <tt>ad_context_bar</tt>-style argument list, generates
the entire header for a page. The title is simply the last element of the argument list.
<i>Your Workspace</i> is included in the header only if the user is currently logged in.

<li><tt><b>wp_header_form</b></tt> is just like <tt>wp_header</tt>, except that the first
argument contains attributes to insert into a <tt>&lt;form&gt;</tt> tag placed at the top
of the page. (We always insert <tt>&lt;form&gt;</tt> at the very top of a page because
placing it anywhere else results in unsightly extra white space.)

<li><tt><b>wp_slider</b></tt> generates a slider given a list of options. It's typically
used like this:

<blockquote><pre>ns_write [wp_slider "age" $age \
    [list [list 7 "Week Old"] [list 30 "Month Old"] [list all "All"]]]</pre></blockquote>
