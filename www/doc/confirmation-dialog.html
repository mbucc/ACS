<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

Several places in the ACS, we have a confirmation page: "Are you sure
you want to nuke this user?". It's a waste of time to write such pages
over and over again. Furthermore, if you decide that you prefer
javascript or some other fancy feature over simple redirects, you have
to edit many different places. Thus, there seems to be a need for a
general solution to this problem.




<h3>Why You Shouldn't Use This Tool (And Also, Why You Might Anyway)</h3>

Confirmation dialogs suck. You know, the little annoying popup-window
that says "Are you sure you want to format your hard drive?". They
suck, mainly because they're so predictable, that we get in the habit
of hitting OK without even looking at them, only to hit OK that one
time, where we didn't mean it.  Never the less, they might be better
than nothing. 

<p>

The alternative is to implement undo, so the action takes place
immediately, but the user can change his mind and undo the
harm. Unfortunately, there are two problems with this approach: (a)
implementing undo is hard, especially on top of today's RDBMS's; and
(b) constructing a good UI for an undoable world is hard. So
confirmation dialogs may be better than nothing, at least in the short
term.

<h3>Under The Hood</h3>

There's a proc, <a
href="proc-one?proc_name=ad_confirm_dlg"><code>ad_confirm_dlg</code></a>
in <code>/packages/acs-core/widgets-procs.tcl</code>. It's really
simple. It will pop up a javascript confirmation dialog and, if the
user hits ok, redirect to the URL provided.

<p>

If you or our client don't like javascript, however, or if you have
needs for more customization, you can use the script,
<code>/shared/confirm.tcl</code>. It takes a bunch of parameters and
does appropriate redirects. The most commonly used arguments are:

<ul>

<li><code>message</code> &#151; what you want displayed to the user.

<li><code>yes_url</code> &#151; will redirect to this URL if the user
clicks OK or yes.

<li><code>no_url</code> &#151; will redirect to this URL if the user
clicks Cancel or no (usually the page we came from).

</ul>

Don't forget to pass it absolute URLs, or it will fail.

<p>



<h3>Future Improvements</h3>

If we want to make the choice between javascript and redirect
transparent to the developer, we need to translate the yes-URL from a
relative URL into an absolute URL, with respect to <code>ns_conn
url</code>. We also need to figure out the URL of the calling page,
which could be done from a combination of <code>ns_conn url</code> and
<code>ns_getform</code>. It's up to the calling developer to make sure
that the page is idempotent, that is, that we can get back to the same
page with the same request that got to it the first time (e.g. a
counter would not fulfill this requirement, since the number change
each time for the same request).
 
<p>

One useful addition would be to let the user say "I don't want to see
any more confirmation dialogs for this action". This would require
that we pass along a unique identifier for the action in question
(something derived from the URL would probably make sense); it would
also require that we record the user's preferences for each type of
action (a' la <code>dont_spam_me_p</code>); and it would require us to
check against this table at each confirmation. All doable.
