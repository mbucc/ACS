The original idea, going back to 1995, of the Neighbor to Neighbor
system was a repository of user experience with various kinds of
merchants.  I should be able to visit the service at
http://photo.net/photo/ and say "I bought a camera via mail from Joe
Smith and it arrived when promised and in the stated condition."  I
should be able to come back a month later and edit the posting and say
"Ooops..  actually the camera had a subtle hidden flaw."

<p>

At the time, it seemed like a very different application from threaded
discussion.  In practice, the bboard system grew much more flexible and
users of the Neighbor service really seemed to need some kind of
grouping/threading of items.

<p>

So why do we still have separate systems?  I think that organizing by
merchants and knowing that people are talking about transactions is
going to be valuable in the long run.  These are specializations that
would really uglify the bboard code and /bboard section of the ad.ini
parameters file.  

<p>

The current code makes good use of the <code>about</code> column
in the <code>neighbor_to_neighbor</code> table.  This would typically be
filled with a merchant name, e.g., "B&H Photo".  In theory, the code can
do much more than this. 

<P>

The original idea was to have several sites running on the same db
server (so there was a <code>domain</code> column).  Then each site
would have several neighbor services, e.g., my personal site could have
a "photographic" category and a "Web servers" category.  Within each
category there would be subcategories, e.g., "Camera Shops" for
"photographic".

<P>

Like all comprehensive ambitious systems designed and operated by stupid
people, neighbor to neighbor never really blossomed.  I ended up using
it at http://photo.net/photo/ with a hardwired domain and a hardwired
primary category.  I don't want to break links from all over the
Internet so I can't really change this now.  Thus there will have to be
a default primary_category in the ad.ini file.

<P>

Another thing that should be added is good support for regionalism.  It
might be useful to have recommendations of roofing contractors but these
have to be broken up by state.  There is a <code>region</code> column in
the data model but I haven't really done anything with the code to
support it.

<p>

Interesting anecdote: in mid-1999, four years after this software was
built, a company called <a
href="http://www.epinions.com">epinions.com</a> in California raised
$millions in venture capital to do the same thing as <a
href="http://photo.net/neighbor/">http://photo.net/neighbor/</a>!

<h3>Configuration</h3>

Here's the section from the ad.ini file:

<blockquote>
<pre><code>
[ns/server/yourservername/acs/neighbor]
; SystemName=Yourdomain Neighbor to Neighbor Service
; SystemOwner= something different (if desired) from SystemOwner above
; HostAdministrator=something different from system-wide
; if you're only going to run one little category, and
; for backward compatibility for photo.net
; this is a category_id referencing the n_to_n_primary_categories
; table
DefaultPrimaryCategory=1
; if someone can't think of more than one; affects links from opc
OnlyOnePrimaryCategoryP=0
; do we offer users a full-text search box
ProvideLocalSearchP=1
; do we use Oracle's Context option (only works if 
; ProvideLocalSearchP=1)
UseContext=0
; do we use standalone PLS search system
UsePLS=0
; do we use AltaVista (only works if ProvideLocalSearchP=0
; and if the site's content is exposed to AltaVista)
LinktoAltaVista=0
SolicitCommentsP=1
CommentApprovalPolicy=wait
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
