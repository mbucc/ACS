System dependencies:  you will be in a world of hurt unless you have
Perl DBI/DBD installed (so that a Perl script on your computer can talk
to Oracle) and a mailer configured to exec a procedure when mail arrives
addressed to a particular alias.

<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

You can build a gateway for handling incoming email messages for your application
using a perl-script called <code>queue-message.pl</code>. <code>queue-message.pl</code> will accept an incoming email message from the mailer and insert its contents into a queue
table in the database. A procedure can be scheduled to sweep the queue at 
some interval to process the messages.
<p>
<h3>Using the <code>queue-message.pl</code> script</h3>

The script takes a list of command-line arguments, which tell it
which database to connect to, and a classification tag for the message.
<p>
<pre>
  usage: queue_message.pl db_datasrc db_user db_passwd destaddr

  Inserts the data from stdin into a queue table.

  Assumes the following table and sequence are defined in the db:

    create table incoming_email_queue (
	    id 		integer primary key,
	    destaddr	varchar(256),
	    content		clob,		-- the entire raw message content
					    -- including all headers
	    arrival_time	date
    );

    create sequence incoming_email_queue_sequence;

</pre>

The <code>destaddr</code> field is a string tag which you can assign
to a message, so that the routine which sweeps the queue can distinguish where
it came from. You might use this if you had several different mail recipient aliases
on your system, which all accept messages and put the into the queue.
<p>

To configure your mailer, you must add a mailer alias which invokes 
the script. For sendmail, this would be done in the aliases file. For qmail,
you create a file in the <code>qmail/alias</code> directory with a name
<code>.qmail-<i>your-alias-here</i></code>.
 <p>
Example: You are setting up an email handler for user feedback messages.
<pre>
.qmail-ticket-handler:
|/web/yourwebserver/bin/queue-message.pl dbi:Oracle: yourdbuser yourdbpassword user_feedback
</pre>

The alias above specified that incoming messages will be piped to the perl script, which will connect to the specified database, and will insert the message with the tag "user_feedback".
<p>


Some guidelines: Try to sure that the <i>from</i> and <i>reply-to</i>
headers on your outgoing message are <b>not</b> the same as your
incoming mail handler alias. This will help prevent the possibility of
nasty mailer loops, in the case where messages may bounce or be returned
for some reason.

<h3>Scheduled Procedures and Parsing Mail Messages</h3>

The procmail Perl script doesn't do anything except fill 
the <code>incoming_email_queue</code> Oracle table.  So
the file <code>/tcl/email-queue</code> schedules
the Tcl procedure <code> process_email_queue</code>
to sweep the queue, and will dispatch on each message tag to a procedure
which you specify in the email-handler section of ad.ini.

<blockquote>
<pre>
[ns/server/photonet/acs/email-queue]
QueueSweepInterval=300
; what to do with a new message
; format is tag|tcl_proc_to_invoke
DispatchPair=na-support|ticket_process_message
</pre>
</blockquote>


The example above specifies that tickets with the tag "na-support" will
be passed to the procedure <code>ticket_process_message</code>.
The Tcl procedure invoked by the dispatcher is passed two arguments: 
a database connection,
and the raw message text. It is up to you to parse or handle the message
in any way you wish. After the call to your dispatch procedure, the message is
deleted from the queue.

<h3>Email Handling Utilities</h3>
Some routines in <code>/tcl/email-utils</code> will help you
parse the raw mail message contents in the db. 
<dl>
<dt><code>parse_email_message <i>message_body</i></code>
<dd>returns an ns_set mapping each mail header to its value, as well as
a key named <i>message_body</i> which contains the message body text.
<dt> clean_up_html <i>html_text</i>
<dd> Returns the html_text with all HTML escape characters quoted properly.
</dl>

<h3>Tips for Oracle 8i Achievers</h3>

Oracle 8i (8.1.5 and later) includes a Java virtual machine.  You are
thus able to load up a Java email parsing library that will take apart
the messages in a queue very nicely (presumably more robustly than the
Tcl kludges in email-utils).
