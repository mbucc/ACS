This document contains some tips that may be useful when
migrating data from a legacy database into ACS Oracle tables
or upgrading an ArsDigita Community System.

<h3>Migrating crud from legacy databases</h3>

There isn't any best way to migrate data.  Here are some reasonable
strategies that we've used.


<h4>Strategy 1: if the legacy data can be loaded into Oracle</h4>

Load your data in as a separate user, GRANT SELECT on these tables to
your ACS Oracle user Once you've got all your data loaded in and owned
by the "otherusername" user, construct statements of the following form:

<blockquote>
<pre><code>
insert into clickthrough_log (local_url, foreign_url, entry_date, click_count)
 select local_url, foreign_url, entry_date, click_count 
 from otherusername.clickthrough_log;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>


<h4>Strategy 2: if the legacy data aren't in Oracle and the data model
isn't documented</h4>

Suppose that you've got a huge database in an Informix database that you
don't really understand.  Get hold of the Data Junction product (see
<a href="http://www.datajunction.com/">http://www.datajunction.com/</a>)
and have it connect to Informix, grab all the data, and stuff them into
Oracle.


<h4>Strategy 3: if you have lots of random losers giving you flat files
in different formats</h4>

Suppose that you have lots of little collectible shops giving you their
inventory data.  You don't think they are sufficiently wizardly in
<i>Excel</i> to massage their columns into your format.  So you're
forced into taking data in all kinds of quirky formats.  Moreover, you
don't want to have to hire a staff of really good programmers to write
conversion scripts for each shop.  What my friend Olin did at
exchange.com was use Data Junction again (<a
href="http://www.datajunction.com/">http://www.datajunction.com/</a>).
It has a little scripting language that was very convenient for this
purpose.



<h4>Strategy 4: if it was your crud to begin with but it is another
brand of RDBMS</h4>

Suppose that you've built up a big collection of data in Sybase and
understand the data model but need to move it to Oracle.  If you are an
expert AOLserver developer, the easiest thing to do is configure a pool
of connections to Sybase and a pool to Oracle.  Then write  scripts
to select from Sybase and insert into Oracle.


<h3>Upgrading ACS</h3>

We're not going to pretend that upgrading an ACS-backed site is trivial,
even if you've followed the religion of /doc/patches and
/doc/custom.  Does this mean that ACS is badly engineered?  Maybe.
But other major RDBMS-backed systems such as SAP suffer from the same
problems.  People have had 20 years to attack this problem and nobody
has come up with a silver bullet.  This is why IT departments tend to
grow monotonically in size and budget.  Also, if we're going to be
innovative we want it to be in collaboration features that users can
use, not in sysadmin/dbadmin or other areas that only programmers will
see. 

<P>

There are two basic strategies for upgrading an ACS.  If you're doing a
minor upgrade, say from 2.3 to 2.4, you'll want to apply the ALTER TABLE
statements to your online Oracle database, create any new tables, add a
few parameters to your ad.ini file, and update your scripts.  If you're
doing a major upgrade from 1.0 to 2.4, you might want to consider
creating a new Oracle user and populating the fresh tables with data
from the online system (see above section on migrating data).  Then
reapply any personality or customizations to a freshly untarred ACS.
Finally you can reconfigure your public Web server to run against the
new ACS installation.

<h4>Upgrading "stop and copy" style</h4>

The /admin/conversion/ directory contains the following scripts that are
useful if you are stopping and copying:

<ul>
<li><code>copy-acs-tables.sql</code> : a good model for copying data from an online
system into a fresh development database for a new ACS version

<li><code>sequence-update</code> : you'll want to make sure that all
your sequences aren't still starting with 1 now that you have old data
in your new tables

<li><code>parameter-differences.pl</code> : this Perl script will help
you identify differences between your ad.ini file and the new ACS's
default; just call it from the shell with two file names as arguments
and view the report on standard output


</ul>


<h4>Upgrading online style</h4>

If you're doing an upgrade to an online database, you'll want to look
at any relevant <code>/doc/sql/upgrade*.sql</code> scripts.  Also,
you'll surely make use of
<code>/admin/conversion/parameter-differences.pl</code> to see what
parameters you must add. Lastly, <code>/install/obsolete.txt</code>
lists files, by release, that you should remove.
