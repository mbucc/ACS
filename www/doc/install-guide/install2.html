<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>
<ul>
    <li>An IBM-PC compatible with a Pentium processor or better.
    <li>128Mb RAM (256 Mb reccomended)
    <li>3.5 Gb Hard Drive space
</ul>

<h3>Installing RedHat Linux 6.2</h3>

This is not intended to be a full set of information on the installation of RedHat Linux.  
For full information, consult the RedHat <a href="http://www.redhat.com/download/howto_download.html">
documentation</a>.<p>

<ol>
  <li>Start the Installation<p>
  You have the following options:<br>
  <ul>
      <li>Install from CDROM.<p>
      You can order an installation CDROM from RedHat or download an ISO image and
      burn one yourself.  Once you have the CDROM, you need to boot the computer.
      If you have a recent BIOS and CDROM, you should be able to boot directly to the
      CDROM.  Check your system's BIOS to see if this is an option and make sure the CDROM
      is set to boot before the primary hard drive.  Then insert the CDROM, boot the computer
      and RedHat should start.  Otherwise, you will need a boot disk.  You can easily create
      one using one of the standard RedHat images.  RedHat offers more 
      <a href="http://www.redhat.com/download/howto_download.html#download">information</a>.
      <li>Install over the Network.<p>
      You can run the RedHat install over the network if you have a fast-enough connection.  
      You'll need to copy roughly 300-600 MB of data, so be prepared.  You need to prepare
      a bootdisk with the network image. 
   </ul><p>
  <li>Boot your computer<p>
  To begin the installation process, insert your boot media and boot your computer.
  RedHat should load and will present you with a LILO prompt.  Read the instructions, but it
  should be safe to press enter unless you have unusual hardware.  The RedHat kernel will then
  load and the installation program will start.  You will need to inform the installation 
  program of what kind of media you are installing from (CDROM or network).<p>
    <li>Select Installation Type<p>
  You need to specify a <strong>Custom</strong> installation type in order to ensure you 
  get all of the necessary packages.<p>
  <li>Partition your drives<p>
  Production linux servers require careful configuration of partitions in order to optimize
  performance.  Such reccomendations are beyond the scope of this document.  A simple 
  configuration for a simple drive is 
  <table>
  <tr><th>Partition Name</th><th>Size</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>/boot</td><td>15 M</td><td>Stores the kernel and basic boot configuration.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>/</td><td>3000+ M</td><td>Stores the major part of the file system.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&lt;swap&gt;</td><td>2x RAM or 256 Mb (whichever is smaller)</td>
      <td>Virtual memory</td></tr>
  </table><p>

  <li>Select packages for installation<p>

The following packages, at a minimum, should be installed.  Feel free to install
above and beyond this.  Also, you may choose to individually select packages.  It
is not necessary to do this, but you may do this to add files to the distribution.
<em>You should not remove any of these packages</em>.  You can also install RPMs post-installation,
so don't feel too concerned about this phase.

<table>
<tr><th>Package</th><th>Description</th><th>Why You Need This</th></tr>
<tr><td>Printer Support<td>Allows you to print<td>If you ever want to print anything.
<tr><td>X Windows<td>Graphical system for UNIX<td>Needed for Oracle installation.
<tr><td>GNOME<td>X Window Manager and GUI<td>Needed to run X properly
<tr><td>Mail/WWW/Tools<td>Tools for checking mail, accessing the web.<td>Basic user programs.

</table><p>


<li>Configure users<p>
Set a password for root.  You do not need to add any more users at this time.<p>

<li>Configure boot device<p>
In order to boot your workstation, you either need to install LILO or have a bootdisk.  The LILO
option is reccomended.  LILO (<b>LI</b>nux<b>LO</b>ader) writes some data to your hard drives MBR
which allows the computer to find the operating system.  It is possible to configure LILO
to boot multiple OSes.  Check the <a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/LILO.html">
LILO documentation</a> for more information.  We reccomend creating an emergency boot disk and 
installing LILO.<p>

<li>Configure networking<p>

RedHat should automatically detect your network card.  You will need to enter in your
networking information or select DHCP.  DHCP will automatically configure your networking,
but your network must have a DHCP server already installed and running.<p>

<li>Configure X<p>
RedHat should automatically detect your graphics card.  You can configure your system
to use a graphical login, but this is not necessary for a production system.  If your monitor is
not listed, select a "Generic" or "Generic Multisync monitor."  
<p>

<li>Copy Files<p>
At this point, sit back while RedHat copies itself over.<p>

<li>Post Install<p>
<ul>
<li>Reboot your system.  If all goes well, you should be able to login as root.  If you did
not configure a graphical login, make sure you can start X.  Do this by logging in
and then typing <code>startx</code>.  You may need to run <code>Xconfiguratior</code>.
<li>Add a user.  You can do <pre>
useradd &lt;<i>username</i>&gt;
passwd &lt;<i>username</i>&gt;
</pre>
</ul>
</ol>

<a name="Oracle"></a>
<h3>Installing Oracle 8.1.6</h3>
<ol>
<li>Acquire Oracle 8.1.6 Enterprise Edition for Linux<p>
<ul>
  <li> You can obtain the software from Oracle's TechNet (http://technet.oracle.com). 
    Free registration is required. The latest version of Oracle 8.1.6 Release 
    2 for Linux. Via ftp, it can be found at:<br>
    <br>
    ftp://ftp.oracle.com/pub/www/otn/linux/oracle8i/oracle8161_tar.gz<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> Note that the Oracle tarball that you will download is huge (&gt; 250Mb). 
    Oracle's site can be maddeningly slow at peak times. An alternative is to 
    order Oracle 8.1.6 on CD-ROM (about $5).</li>
  <li> Oracle 8.1.6 now comes with a Java RunTime Environment built-in to the 
    distribution, so you no longer have to downlaod and install it separately.</li>
  <li>After the download is complete, untar the file to a convenient location.<b><br>
    </b></li>
</ul>
<p>
   <li>Things to Keep in Mind<p>
Throughout these instructions, we will refer to a service name or SID of <b>ora8</b>.  
You may choose to customize this.  If so, change any reference to <b>ora8</b> excluding
pathnames to your customized name.  If you are confused by this, stick to using <b>ora8</b>.
<p>

   <li>Pre-Install Tasks<p>
Though Oracle 8.1.6 has an automated installer, we still need to perform several 
  manual, administrative tasks before we can launch it.  You must perform all of these
steps as the <i>root</i> user.<p>

<ul>
<li>Setup the Oracle group and account.<p>
    We need to create a user called &quot;oracle&quot;, which is used to install 
    the product, as well as start and stop the database. 
    <ol>
    <li>Make sure you are running as the root user.<p>
    <li>Open a terminal window<p>
    <li>In the terminal window, create the groups and users:<p>
<pre>
# groupadd dba
# groupadd oinstall
# useradd -g oinstall -G dba -m oracle
# passwd oracle <i>{to change the password}</i>
</pre>
</ol>
<p>
<li>Make the Proper Mount Points<p>
Oracle can be mounted in a variety of places, but we will put it in the
places that ArsDigita conventionally uses, to make our ACS installation that much smoother. 
   <ol>
   <li>Make a directory for Oracle.  
       Make sure that the drive that you're installing this on has at least 2 gigs free.<p>
<pre>
# mkdir /ora8
# cd /ora8
# mkdir m01 m02 m03 

# chown -R oracle.dba /ora8 {change the owner to oracle from root..}
</pre>
<li>Log out as the root user.<p>
</ol>
</ul>

<li>Set up the Oracle user's Environment<p>
<ul>
  <li>Log in as user &quot;oracle&quot;<p>
  <li>Open a terminal window<p>
  <li>Use a text editor to edit the <b>.bash_profile </b>file in the oracle 
    account's home directory.p>
  <li>Add the following lines to this file:</p>
  <pre>
ORACLE_BASE=/ora8/m01/app/oracle
export ORACLE_BASE
ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_BASE/product/8.1.6
export ORACLE_HOME
PATH=$PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/bin
export PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:/lib:/usr/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
ORACLE_SID=ora8     <i>{Change this if needed.}</i>
export ORACLE_SID
ORACLE_TERM=vt100
export ORACLE_TERM
ORA_NLS33=$ORACLE_HOME/ocommon/nls/admin/data
export ORA_NLS33
umask 022
NLS_LANG=american
export NLS_LANG
</pre>
  <li>Save the file<p>
  <li>Log out as oracle<p>
  <li>Log back in as oracle<p>
  <li>type: '<b>env</b>' <p>
  <li>You should see all of the variables that we just typed in to the <b>.bash_profile</b> 
    above. If you don't, you probably made a typo. Go back to the file &amp; fix 
    it.<p>
  <li>Make sure that<b> /bin</b>, <b>/usr/bin</b>, and <b>/usr/local/bin</b> 
    are in your path (you should have seen them when you typed out 'env'.) If 
    they are not, then add them to the .bash_profile above. (that is, if you don't 
    see /usr/local/bin in your path, add it by changing the PATH statement above 
    to PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:$ORACLE_HOME/bin)<p.
  <li>We are now ready to install Oracle. Whew.<p>
  <p>&nbsp;<p>
</ul>


<li>Oracle Install<p>
<ul>
  <li>Log in as user oracle<p>
  <li>If you are installing Oracle from a CD-ROM, you've got to mount it first. 
    Open a terminal window, then:<p>
      <pre>
$ su root <i>{enter your root password}</i>
# mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
# exit <i>{to exit from superuser status}</i>
</pre>
  <li>To start up the installer:<p>
      <pre>
$ cd /mnt/cdrom/install/linux <i>{if you downlaoded it from 
Technet&amp; aren't using a CD-ROM,}  {then cd to: wherever it was 
untarred]/Oracle8iR2/install/linux}</i>
$ ./runInstaller
</pre>

  <li>If all is well, a window will open that welcomes you to the Oracle Universal 
    Installer.Click on &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li>Make sure that the &quot;Source&quot; path says <b>[wherever you mounted 
    the CDROM]/stage/products.jar</b>.<p>
  <li> The destination path should be automatically set to the same path as the 
<b>$ORACLE_HOME</b> variable that we set in the <b>.bash_profile</b>.<p>
  <li> Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot; if both paths are correct. If not, re-check 
    your .bash_profile to make sure it's right.<p>
  <li> You will need to specify an <b>oraInventory</b> path for the install program to
  store information.  We reccomend <b>$ORACLE_BASE/oraInventory</b>.
  <li> At the Unix Group Name window, enter &quot;<b>oinstall</b>&quot;<b> </b>as 
    the Unix Group Name. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> A window now pops-up, complaining that the script orainstRoot.sh needs 
    to be run with root privaleges. Here's how to do it:<p>
      <p> Open a new terminal window, then type:<p>
      <pre>
$ su root {then enter root's password}
# cd $ORACLE_HOME
# ./orainstRoot.sh
# exit <i>{to exit superuser privs.}</i>
# exit <i>{to close the term}</i> 
</pre>
  <li>Go back to the pop-up window and click on &quot;<b>Retry</b>&quot;<p>
  <li> You'll now be at the &quot;Available Products&quot; screen. Make sure 
    that the &quot;<b>Oracle 8i Enterprise Edition 8.1.6.1.0</b>&quot; button 
    is selected. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li>Select the &quot;<b>Custom</b>&quot; installation type, and hit &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li>At the &quot;Available Product Components&quot; screen, you can accept 
    all of the default modules that are checked for installation. Scroll down 
    to the bottom of the list, and make sure that <b>Oracle SQLJ 8.1.6.0 </b>is 
    also checked (in releases 8.1.5 and 8.1.6 , it was unchecked by default.) Then, click 
    &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot; on the Component Locations screen.<p>
  <li> Enter &quot;dba&quot; for the user groups on the privileged operating 
    system groups.. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> The installer now asks if you want to &quot;<b>Create a Database</b>&quot; 
    Select <b>No</b> {We will do this later}. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> Now we are at the &quot;<b>Summary</b>&quot; Screen. <p>
  <li> Click on &quot;<b>Install</b>&quot;. <p>
  <li> The install begins. This should take about 20 minutes.<p>
  <li> After the installation finishes, you will see another pop-up window asking 
    you to run a script called root.sh. To run it:<p>
    <p>Open a new terminal window, then type:<br>
<pre>
$ su root {enter root password}
# cd $ORACLE_HOME
# chmod 744 root.sh
# ./root.sh

Hit "Enter" when it asks for the path to the local bin directory. Then:

# exit <i>{exit superuser status}</i>
$ exit <i>{close the terminal}</i>
</pre>

  <li> Go back to the pop-up window and hit &quot;<b>OK</b>&quot;<p>
  <li> The &quot;Configuration Tools&quot; screen opens up. You are now faced 
    with the &quot;Net8 Configuration Assistant&quot;. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> Select &quot;<b>No</b>&quot; for the Net8 directory service access configuration. 
    Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> Accept the default listener name of <b>&quot;listener&quot;</b>
. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;. 
  <li> Select protocols: TCP/IP should already be in the list of selected protcolrs. 
Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot; for the default port number of 1521.<p>
  <li> The next screen defaults to "No."  Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot; 
-- we don't want to configure another listener. 
  <p>
  <li> On the naming methods configuration screen, select &quot;<b>No</b>&quot;, 
    then click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> Click &quot;<b>Finish</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> We've reached the &quot;End of Installation&quot; screen. (hard to believe, 
    huh?) <p>
  <li> Click &quot;<b>Next Install</b>&quot;, then &quot;<b>Exit</b>&quot;, 
    then &quot;<b>Yes</b>&quot;.<p>
  <p>&nbsp;<p>
</ul>

<li>Creating a Database<p>
<ul>
  <li>In a terminal window (still as the oracle user) type:<p>
  <pre>
    <p> $ dbassist &amp;
  </pre>

  <li> The Oracle Database Configuration Agent will fire up. <p>
  <li> Select &quot;<b>Create a database</b>&quot;; hit &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;<p>
  <li> Select &quot;<b>Custom</b>&quot;, hit &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> Select &quot;<b>Multipurpose</b>&quot;. hit &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> Select &quot;<b>60</b>&quot; concurrent users. Hit &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> Select &quot;<b>Dedicated Server Mode</b>&quot;. Hit &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> Accept all of the options, and hit &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;<p>
  <li> For &quot;global database name&quot;, enter &quot;<b>ora8</b>&quot;. For 
    &quot;SID&quot;, also enter &quot;<b>ora8</b>&quot; [it should do this automatically.] 
    Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> Accept the defaults for the next screen (control file locations.) Click 
    &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> Go to the &quot;<b>temporary</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>rollback</b>&quot; 
    tabs, and change the Size (upper-right text box) to <b>150</b>Mb. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> Increase the redo log sizes to <b>10000K</b> each. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> Use the default checkpoint interval &amp; timeout. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>.&quot;<p>
  <li> Increase &quot;<b>Processes</b>&quot; to <b>100</b>; &quot;<b>Block Size</b>&quot; 
    to <b>4096</b> (better for small Linux boxes; aD uses 8192 on the big Solaris 
    machines.).<p>
  <li> Accept the defaults for the Trace File Directory. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>
  <li> Finally, select &quot;<b>Save information to a shell script</b>&quot; 
    and hit &quot;<b>Finish</b>.&quot; [we're going to examne the contents of 
    this file before creating our database.}<p>
  <li> Hit the &quot;<b>Save</b>&quot; button [use the default directory that 
    it gives you. the file will automatically be called &quot;sqlora8.sh&quot; 
    and be in the directory /ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6/assistants/dbca/jlib]<p>
  <li> It will alert you that the script has been saved successfully.<p>
  <li> Now, look for the file &quot;initora8.ora&quot;, which should be in /ora8/m01/app/oracle/admin/ora8/pfile.<p>
  <li> Use your text editor to edit &quot;initora8.ora&quot;. We are going to 
    add the following line to the end:<p>
<pre>
nls_date_format = &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;
</pre>
  <li> find the open_cursors line in the file, and change it to:<p>
<pre>
open_cursors = 500
</pre>

  <li> save the file.<p>  This is a good time to shut down X and login via the console.
  You can switch to a virtual console by doing "Ctrl-Alt-F1".
  Database creation will proceed significantly faster if more RAM is available.<p>
  <li> change directory to: /ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6/assistants/dbca/jlib<p>
  <li> type: <pre>./sqlora8.sh</pre>
  <li> Your database will now be built. It will take &gt; 1 hour. No fooling. 
    You will see lots of errors scroll by (like: &quot;ORA-01432: public synonym 
    to be dropped does not exist&quot;) Fear not, this is normal.<p>
  <p>Eventually, you'll be returned to your shell prompt. In the meantime, go 
    get some food.<p>
</ul>
<li>Testing Your New Database<p>
  <p>Did it work? Now's the time to find out.<p>
<ul>
  <li> Make sure you're logged in as user oracle.<p>
  <li> Open up a term <p>
  <li> you need to download the &quot;Oracle Acceptance Test&quot; file. It's 
    available at: http://photo.net/wtr/oracle/acceptance-sql.txt<br>
    (just type <b>wget http://photo.net/wtr/oracle/acceptance-sql.txt</b> and 
    it will automatically download to your /home/oracle directory.)<p>
  <li> Rename the file:<p>
<pre>
$ mv acceptance-sql.txt acceptance.sql
</pre>

  <li> Once you've got the acceptance test file all set, stay in your term and 
    type the following: <p>
<pre>
$ mkdir -p /ora8/m03/oradata/ora8
$ sqlplus system {we are entering Oracle's SQL*Plus program;} 
                 {type "manager" when asked for a password.}
</pre>
 Now that you're into SQL*Plus, change the default passwords for system, sys, and ctxsys to 
"alexisahunk" (or change them to something  you'll remember):
<pre>
SQL> alter user system identified by alexisahunk;
SQL> alter user sys identified by alexisahunk;
SQL> alter user ctxsys identified by alexisahunk;
</pre>
Now we'll create a new tablespace:
<pre>
SQL> create tablespace web 
     datafile '/ora8/m03/oradata/ora8/web.dbf' 
     size 50m autoextend on;
</pre>
And we'll create a user:
<pre>
SQL> create user web identified by web 
     default tablespace web 
     temporary tablespace temp 
     quota unlimited on web; 
</pre>
<pre>
SQL> grant create session to web;
SQL> grant connect,resource to web;
</pre>
Next, quit out of SQL*Plus:
<pre>
SQL> quit
</pre>
Log back into SQL*Plus as user "web"
<pre>
$ sqlplus web {password: web}
SQL>@/[path to the acceptancesql file]/acceptance.sql
</pre>

  <li> The system will now churn for several minutes. This is normal.<p>
  <li> If there are no errors, then consider yourself fortunate. Your Oracle 
    installation is working.<p>
</ul>


<li>Automating Startup &amp; Shutdown<p>

You will want to automate the database startup and shutdown process. It's probably 
best to have Oracle spring to life when you boot up your machine. <p>
<ul>
  <li> open a term; become the root user<p>
  <pre> 
$ su root <i>{enter root pw}</i>
# cd /etc
</pre>
  <li> edit the file 'oratab'<p>
  <li> you will see a line &quot;ora8:/ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6:N&quot; 
  <p>
  <li> change the last letter from &quot;N&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;. This tells 
    Oracle that you want the database to start when the machine boots.<p>
  <li> Save the file &amp; quit the term<p>
  <li> You need a script to automate startup and shutdown.  
       Save the <a href="oracle8i">script</a> as <b>/etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle8i</b>
  <li> Open a term, as the root user. Make the script executable:<p>
<pre>
# chmod +x /etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle8i
</pre>
  <li> Test the script. change to the /etc/rc.d/init directory, then type:<p>
<pre>
# ./oracle8i stop
# ./oracle8i start
# ./oracle8i restart
# ./oracle8i invalid-parameter
</pre>

  <li> If it works OK, then you've got to link it so it automatically runs on 
    shutdown or reboot.  First, for shutdown.
<pre>
# ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle8i /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/K10oracle8i
# ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle8i /etc/rc.d/rc6.d/K10oracle8i
</pre>
  <li>To make sure Oracle starts automatically on boot (at runlevels 2, 3, and 5):
<pre>
# ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle8i /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S99oracle8i
# ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle8i /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S99oracle8i
# ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle8i /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/S99oracle8i
</pre>
</ul>

<li>Test the automation<p>
Reboot your computer and ensure that Oracle starts automatically
by starting sqlplus.  If it works, then your Oracle installation is complete.
</ol>

<a name="AOLServer"></a>
<h3>Installing AOLServer 3.0</h3>

<ul>
<li>Download it from <a href="http://arsdigita.com/download/">ArsDigita.com</a> or from
the <a href="http://aolserver.com/">AOLServer web site</a>.
<li>Configure the system for build: check Makefile and include/Makefile.global.  You
may want to set an install directory in Makefile.global.  By default $INST is set to /tmp.  We set it
to /usr/local/aolserver.  Make sure you have permissions to write to this directory.
<li>Run 'make'
<li>Run 'make install' to copy over an installation distribution.  Optionally create a directory
to deposit the files and set permissions.  We created a user, web, chowned the directory /webroot/aol3
to web, and then copied over the AOLServer installation.
</ul>

<h3>Configuring AOLServer</h3>

The <a href="http://arsdigita.com/doc/installation.html">ACS Installation Documentation</a> reccomends 
creating a chrooted environment for configuring AOLServer.  However, no configuration information
is given about how to create this directory.  This would be useful.<p>

AOLServer can be configued with two different configuration files: nsd.tcl and nsd.ini.  By default,
nsd.tcl is used.  However, the ACS uses a special file, parameters.ini for its own configuration.  
In order to use this file, you need to be using nsd.ini.  By default, AOLServer comes with nsd.tcl,
but you can translate this: from the aol3 directory, run <code>bin/translate-tcl <nsd.tcl >nsd.ini</code>.
<br>
<font color=red>CHECK THIS: does parameters.ini work with nsd.tcl? </strong>
<p>

If you use nsd.ini, make sure that the home directory is properly set, or AOLServer will not work.  
Edit nsd.ini, and set 
<pre>
home=/webroot/aol3
</pre><p>

You should also comment out all references to nsssl.  <p>

Test to make sure your installation is running.  <code>bin/nsd -fc nsd.ini -s server1</code>.  Surf over to 
localhost:8000, and make sure you can see the page.<p>

<h3>Installing Monitors</h3>

(note: Cassandracle and Cassandrix untar to directories named cassandracle and cassandrix.
This is convenient for installation purposes.  MTA Montior untars to /www/mmon.  It should untar to /mmon.)  

<h3>Installing Oracle</h3>
Create user oracle (primary GID oinstall, secondary dba)

Untar the archive.  Cd to /OracleRi2
Type ./runInstaller.

File Locations:
Source (automatically set)<br>
Destination /ora8/m01
OraInventory /ora8/.oraInventory
Database directory /ora8/m02
Set Install group to oinstall
Typical Installation.
Name your database.  This name is used for accessing the db from oracle tools.
You need a service name and a system identifier: SID.  The service name should be a database name and
your domain.  For instance, we used chaos.arsdigita.com.  This gives us a SID of chaos.
Wait.

A database will be created for you with two accounts:
SYS, change_on_install (lucky2)
SYSTEM, manager        (lucky)

Post-install

Edit the init-scripts for your shell (e.g. .bashrc) and set the (supposedly optional)
ORACLE_BASE and ORACLE_HOME environment variables.
<pre>
ORACLE_BASE=/ora8/m01
ORACLE_HOME=/ora8/m01
ORACLE_SID=SID
</pre>

http://www.arsdigita.com/doc/installation.html

Architecture install has a legacy print-out of Oracle data files.

Find where the tablespaces are stored 

                    SVRMGR>  select file_name from dba_data_files;

              Example results: 

                    /ora8/m01/app/oracle/oradata/ora8/system01.dbf
                    /ora8/m01/app/oracle/oradata/ora8/oemrep01.dbf
                    /ora8/m01/app/oracle/oradata/ora8/rbs01.dbf
                    /ora8/m01/app/oracle/oradata/ora8/temp01.dbf
                    /ora8/m01/app/oracle/oradata/ora8/users01.dbf
                    /ora8/m01/app/oracle/oradata/ora8/indx01.dbf
                    /ora8/m01/app/oracle/oradata/ora8/drsys01.dbf
                    /ora8/m02/oradata/ora8/jsc01.dbf (misleading!)

A fresh installation looks like this:

SVRMGR> select file_name from dba_data_files;
FILE_NAME                                                                       
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/ora8/m01/oradata/order/tools01.dbf                                             
/ora8/m01/oradata/order/drsys01.dbf                                             
/ora8/m01/oradata/order/users01.dbf                                             
/ora8/m01/oradata/order/indx01.dbf                                              
/ora8/m01/oradata/order/rbs01.dbf                                               
/ora8/m01/oradata/order/temp01.dbf                                              
/ora8/m01/oradata/order/system01.dbf                                            
7 rows selected.

Export and Import *must* be done from svrmgrl.  This is not specified in the documentation.

For the export-oracle script, all instances of 'app/oracle/product/8.1.5/' should be deleted.

<h3>Installing the ACS</h3>
When configuring service-name.ini, delete the [ns/setup] section.  This was only for AOLServer 2.3.3.
Must set a Port for the [ns/server/service_name/module/nssock]
nscache.so is also deprecated.

When compiling Oracle driver, one usually gets the warning 
<pre>
ld: warning: type and size of dynamic symbol `sskgslgf' are not defined
</pre>

This should be more prominently documented.

Provide documentation for [ns/parameters] in nsd.ini.

Include instructions to update the webserver user's LD_LIBRARY_PATH with the $ORACLE_HOME/lib

ArsDigita Server installation references 'nsd-oracle' which is deprecated.
Keepalive installation instructions references a 'restart-aolserver' script which we could not find
on the web, but had from bootcamp.

Knowing where nsd-oracle is would help a lot.


<h3>Setting up Glassroom</h3>
Exactly what must one do?

<h3>Setting up Monitors</h3>
ad-utilities-preload.tcl should be included with KeepAlive, WatchDog, etc.
Watchdog needs better setup instructions.
Glassroom needs better setup instructions.

<h3>Using CVS</h3>
