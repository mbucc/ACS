<h3>About This Document</h3>

This guide is intended primarily for programmers writing new modules
for the ArsDigita Community System.  It provides instructions for
turning an ACS module into an ACS package with the new <a
href="core-arch-guide/apm">ACS Package Manager</a>.

<h3>Background</h3>

From the ACS 4.0 <a href="/doc/core-arch-guide/apm">package manager documentation</a> (as of 25 April 2000):

<blockquote>The ACS is composed of a set of software components known as
<em>packages</em>. Some packages merely provide services to other
packages (e.g., the community core routines, or the security
and session management routines). Other packages provide
a service directly to the end-user (e.g., registration,
news, or FAQs); these application packages are known as <em>modules</em>.
(Thus every module is a package, but not vice versa.)

<p>In the past, there has never been any sort of official distinction
between packages and no system for tracking which files belong to which package,
aside from informal documentation.
Our goal is to provide a central registry and manager for packages. The benefits:

<ul>
  <li>Clear ownership and responsibility for individual services.
  <li>A standard process for installing and upgrading packages.
  <li>Independent versioning of packages, so components can be upgraded individually,
      preserving local changes.
  <li>Standard interfaces (contracts) for interdependent packages, so I won't break
      your package by changing mine.
  <li>A good interface for installing and configuring ACS.
</ul>

<p>ACS 3.3 includes an APM that provides a subset of the
desired functionality.  ACS 3.3 was the last monolithic release of
ACS: ACS 4.0 will consist of a set of distinct packages (the address
book, the bboard, etc.)  which will be individually versionable and
upgrading. During the wait for the ACS 4.0 release, package owners can
still distribute upgrades to their packages by posting tarballs
(<code>.apm</code> files) on <code>software.arsdigita.com</code>. The package
manager will automate all this.
</blockquote>

<h3>So What Do I Have To Do?</h3>

Every package owner (a.k.a. module owner) needs to use the
package manager on dev.arsdigita.com
to register their packages. The process is very easy. Just

<ol>

<li>Register as a site-wide administrator on your web service.<p>

<li>Go to the package manager on your server.  The URL is <a href="/admin/apm">http://yourservername/admin/apm/</a>.<p>

<li>Click the <i>Add a new package</i> link.<p>

<li>Follow the prompts to type in the information for your package.
If this is a new package under development, use 0.5 for the initial
    version.  Otherwise, exercise your judgement and choose an
    appropriate version number.
Note that the package URL and version URL are filled in automatically
    for you. <p>
   Choose your <strong>package key</strong> with care, as it will be
    used in the file registration process next.<p>

<li>Click <i>Create Package</i>.<p>

<li>At this point, your package is created, but no files are yet
    registered as a part of it.  APM enforces a number of conventions
    with regards to file names and locations that must be followed.
    Please refer to this table for help in conforming to the
    conventions.  A package must include some of these files, but not
    all of them depending on your software.  Carefully check to make
    sure that you have moved all the files to
    their new locations.  You can optionally add the files to CVS.
    <p>

    Your <code>package-root</code> is installation
    specific and is usually something like
    <code>/web/yourservername/packages</code>.
    We will use the <strong>address-book</strong> table as an
    example in this table.  You should be able to substitute your
    package key when following the table below.  For
    further information, please consult the <a
    href="/doc/core-arch-guide/apm">APM documentation</a>.<p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>File Purpose</th><th>Convention</th><th>Address-Book Example</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Package specification.</td>
    <td><code>package-root/<em>package</em>/<em>package</em>.info</code>
	<br><center>(created automatically)<center></td>
    <td><code>package-root/address-book/address-book.info</code></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>

    <td>
<code>package-root/<em>package</em>/<em>package</em>-create.sql</code>

    <td>
	<code>package-root/address-book/upgrade/upgrade-2.0-2.0.1.sql</code><br>
	<code>package-root/address-book/upgrade/upgrade-2.0.1-2.1.sql</code><br>	
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Tcl init scripts to be run at server startup<br>(e.g. filter registration)</td>
    <td><code>package-root/<em>package</em>/<em>package</em>-init.tcl</code></td>
    <td><code>package-root/address-book/address-book-init.tcl</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tcl scripts that define procedures<br>(e.g. procedures that
	multiple pages use)</td>
    <td><code>package-root/<em>package</em>/<em>package</em>-procs.tcl</code></td>
    <td><code>package-root/address-book/address-book-procs.tcl</code></td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>User-viewable pages</td>
    <td><code>package-root/<em>package</em>/www/</code></td>
    <td><code>package-root/address-book/www/</code></td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Admin pages</td>
    <td><code>package-root/<em>package</em>/admin-www/</code></td>
    <td><code>package-root/address-book/admin-www/</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Documentation</td>
    <td><code>package-root/<em>package</em>/www/doc/</code></td>
    <td><code>package-root/address-book/www/doc/</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>

The directory hierarchy might look like this:

<blockquote><pre>
/web/yourservername
  +-- packages (directory)
        +-- address-book (directory)
        |     +-- address-book.html
        |     +-- address-book-procs.tcl
        |     +-- address-book-init.tcl
        |     +-- address-book.info
        |     +-- upgrade (directory)
        |     |     +-- upgrade-2.0-2.0.1.sql
        |     |     +-- upgrade-2.0.1-2.1.sql
        |     +-- www (directory)
        |           +-- index.tcl
        |           +-- records.tcl
        |           +--   ...
        |           +-- admin (directory)
        |                 +-- index.tcl
        |                 +--   ...
        +-- bboard
              ...
</pre></blockquote>
<p>

<li>Now, from the package information page for your package, select
    <em>Manage File Information</em>.  Click the
    <em>Scan</em> link to have APM scan the package
    directory.  It should provide you with options to add all of your
    package files.  Double check that all of your files are included.
    If so, confirm the addition.
    <p>
    If there are any files in your package which the package manager
    wasn't able to find or if you need to add files later, copy the
    file into the package directory and click the
    <em>Manage File Information</em> and <em>Scan</em> 
    link just as before.  Your new files should be detected.  You can
    remove files using the file manager.  Repeat this step as necessary until you've
    nailed down all the files in your package.<p>

<li>Your package is now installed.  You can now toggle the activation
    status of your package.  To 
    toggle the activation status, go to your package's page and select 
    <em>Enable this version of the package</em>.  This
    instructs the request processor to start serving your page.  The
    request processor will automatically translate URLs of the style
    <code>http://yourserver.com/package/*</code> to read files from
    <code>package-root/package/www/</code>.  However, you will need to 
    restart the server and to run data model scripts yourself before your module will work.
    At any time you can disable your package and after the server is
    restarted its URLs will no longer be served.<p>

<li>Once you've restarted your server and verified that your package
    is working, you can <em>Generate a distribution file</em> from
    your package's information page.  This will create a
    <code>.apm</code> tarball that you can distribute to anyone using
    the ArsDigita Community System for easy installation.
    <p>
        
<li>Repeat steps 3 through 9 for each additional package you own.<p>

</ul>

And you're done! ACS thanks you.

<h3>And Why Am I Doing This Again?</h3>

Most importantly:

<ul>
<li>So we can keep track of ownership and responsibility the individual components of ACS.
<li>So we can release upgrades of individual packages without monolithic ACS releases.
<li>To make installation and upgrading of ACS far easier and more automated, especially
on client sites where lots of files have been locally modified/customized.
</ul>

This things will make ACS much more approachable and desirable to new users, and
make it easier for us to keep improving and streamlining ACS.
