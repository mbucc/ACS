<h2>ACS 3.3 Release Notes</h2>

by <a href=mailto:ron@arsdigita.com>ron@arsdigita.com</a> and Richard Li

<hr>

<p>This release of the ArsDigita Community System is the first step in
a major improvement in the core architecture.  With ACS 3.3 we are
introducing the following key changes:

<ul>
<li> <a href=/doc/core-arch-guide/apm>Package Management</a>, which has caused a
number of <a href="/doc/acs-3-3-and-beyond">structural changes</a> to
ACS startup, the file system, and more
<li><a href="/doc/core-arch-guide/request-processor">Request-Processing Pipeline</a>
</ul>

<p>We highly suggest that anyone upgrading to ACS 3.3 read <i><a
href="/doc/acs-3-3-and-beyond">ACS 3.2 Developer's Guide to ACS 3.3
and Beyond</a></i>, which discusses the many fundamental and
far-reaching changes to the ACS architecture.</p>

<p>Both installations using a clean database and upgrades from ACS
3.2.3 have been tested using Oracle 8.1.6, <a
href="http://www.arsdigita.com/aol3/">AOLserver 3+ad2</a> in a <a
href="/doc/security">chrooted environment</a>, and Tcl 8.3.  With ACS
3.3 we have dropped all backwards-compatibilities with AOLserver 2. We
do not guarantee that ACS 3.3 works with AOLserver 2.3. This release
marks the first time that we used a formal QA process, which included
internal alpha and beta releases, dedicated testers, and daily fresh
installs and upgrades of the latest version of the code tree. For the
next release, we plan on opening this process to the ACS community,
with a dedicated ticket tracker and postings of alpha and beta
releases of ACS. In the meantime, please email <a href="mailto:
bugs@arsdigita.com">bugs@arsdigita.com</a> with any critical bugs
(along with any patches you may have), including a description of the
problem, the file(s) that exhibit the problem, and any other
information that you feel is relevant.</p>

<p>Other new features, enhancements, and changes:

<ul>
<li>Reorganized, updated, and more user-friendly <a
href=/doc/>documentation</a>
<li>a <a href="/doc/core-arch-guide/database-access-api">Database API</a>
<li>a preliminary version of the <a href="/doc/documents">Documents
API</a>
<li>the <a href="/doc/template/">dynamic publishing system</a> (not an ACS
standard yet, but available for those who wish to use it)
<li><a href="/doc/wap">support for WAP</a>
<li>Many, many bug fixes, including the following fixes you may want
to apply to your older ACS installation, even if you don't want to
upgrade the entire installation:
    <ul>
    <li>fix for the <a href="/doc/admin-guide/server-cluster">server
    clustering module</a> (older version causes huge load on servers
    due to thread issues)
    <li>fix for <tt>return</tt> commands inside procedures
    (fixed with the introduction of <a
    href="/doc/proc-one?proc_name=ad%5fscript%5fabort"><tt>ad_script_abort</tt></a>;
    see <a href="/doc/programming-with-aolserver">programming with
    AOLserver</a> for details). Note that using <tt>ad_script_abort</tt> in older ACS implementations (pre-RPP) is non-trivial because you will need to implement some mechanism to catch the error thrown by <tt>ad_script_abort</tt>.
    <li>replacement of <tt>ns_returnredirect</tt> with
    <a
    href="/doc/proc-one?proc_name=ad%5freturnredirect"><tt>ad_returnredirect</tt></a>
    <li>the entire ACS now uses the <a
    href="/doc/abstract-url">abstract URL system</a>
    </ul>
<li>ns_register_filter and ns_register_proc have been obsoleted and
disabled; they are replaced by <tt><a
href="/doc/proc-one?proc_name=ad%5fregister%5ffilter">ad_register_filter</a></tt>
and <tt><a
href="/doc/proc-one?proc_name=ad%5fregister%5fproc">ad_register_proc</a></tt>
as documented in the <a href="/doc/core-arch-guide/request-processor">Request
Processor documentation</a>
</ul>

Known issues:

<ul>
<li>Nuking user groups and users doesn't work. This will be fixed in
a future release of ACS. Meanwhile, we suggest that you ban users
instead of nuking them.
<li>Users who have saved their authentication information in a cookie
will need to relogin to the web site, since cookies are not backwards
compatible.
<li>top requires access to /proc and /dev/kmem in order to operate;
this is a security risk in a chroot environment. One possible way to
maintain chroot security and enable the top monitoring page is to
create a separate user that writes the results of top to a text file,
and have the page read that text file.
<li>Users running InterMedia 8.1.6 and using UTF-8 encoding will need
to obtain a patch from Oracle support in order to get Intermedia to
work.
</ul>
