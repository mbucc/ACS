<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

Many of the pages on an ACS-based website are hidden from robots
(a.k.a. search engines) by virtue of the fact that login is required to
access them. A generic way to expose login-required content to robots is
to redirect all requests from robots to a special URL that is designed
to give the robot what at least appear to be linked .html files.

<p>

You might want to use this software for situations where public (not
password-protected) pages aren't getting indexed by a specific robot.
Many robots won't visit pages that look like CGI scripts, e.g., with
question marks and form vars (this is discussed in <a
href="http://photo.net/wtr/thebook/publicizing.html">Chapter 7</a> of
<cite>Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing</cite>).

<h3>The Medium-sized Picture</h3>

In order for this to work, we need a way to distinguish robots from
human beings.  Fortunately, the <a
href="http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/active.html">Web
Robots Database</a> maintains a list of active robots that they kindly
publish as a <a
href="http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/active/all.txt">text
file</a>. By loading this list
into the database, we can implement the following algorithm:

<ol>
<li>Check the <code>User-Agent</code> of each HTTP request against those of known robots (which are stored in the <code>robot_useragent</code> column of the <code>robots</code> table).
<li>If there is a match, redirect to the special URL.
<li>This special URL can either be a static page or a dynamic script that dumps lots of juicy text from the database, for the robot's indexing pleasure.
</ol>

<p>

This algorithm is implemented by a postauth filter proc: <code>ad_robot_filter</code>.

<p>

(<em>Note:</em> For now, we are only storing the minimum number of
fields needed to detect robots, so many of the columns in the
<code>robots</code> table will be empty. Later, if the need presents
itself, we can enhance the code to parse out and store all fields.)

<h3>Configuration Parameters</h3>

<pre>
[ns/server/yourservername/acs/robot-detection]
; the URL of the Web Robots DB text file
WebRobotsDB=http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/active/all.txt
; which URLs should ad_robot_filter check (uncomment to turn system on)
; FilterPattern=/members-only-stuff/*.html
; FilterPattern=/members-only-stuff/*.tcl
; the URL where robots should be sent
RedirectURL=/robot-heaven/
; How frequently (in days) the robots table
; should be refreshed from the Web Robots DB
RefreshIntervalDays=30
</pre>

<h3>Notes for the Site Administrator</h3>

<ul>

<li>
Though admin pages exist for this module, there should be no need to
use them in normal operation. This is because the ACS automatically
refreshes the contents of the <code>robots</code> table at startup, if
it is empty or if its data is older than the number of days specified
by the <code>RefreshIntervalDay</code> configuration parameter (see
below).

<li>
If no <code>FilterPattern</code>s are specified in the configuration,
then the robot detection filter will <em>not</em> be installed.

</ul>

<h3>Set Up</h3>

<ul>

<li>build a non-password protected site starting at /robot-heaven/
(that's the default destination), using <code>ns_register_proc</code> if
necessary to create a pseudo static HTML file appearance

<li>specify directories and file types you want filtered and bounced
into /robot-heaven/ (from the ad.ini file)

<li>restart AOLserver

<li>visit the /admin/robot-detection/ admin page to see whether your
configs took effect

<li>view your server error log to make sure that the filters are getting
registered

</ul>
