<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

This is a system for managing a set of manuals or books through the
database.  This system allows users to view a dynamically generated
table of contents, view sections and make comments on sections.
Administrators can add, delete, edit and rearrange sections.  Manuals
can also have figures or use image to decorate their pages.

<p>

Printable versions of the manual are produced using <a
href="http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc/htmldoc">HTMLDOC</a>.
Readers can download the complete manual in HTML or PDF;
PostScript is an option but almost never what you want to offer for
download because of size relative to PDF. 

<p>

As an option, the system can be configured to use <a
href=http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_toc>CVS</a> to manage
version control for section content.  If there is any chance of
concurrent edits, CVS should be installed and turned on in this
module.  Trying to avoid this by keeping track of locks in the
database is ugly and we don't support it because basically you just
end up with a bad re-implementation of CVS.

<h3>Our data model</h3>

We use three tables to store all content for a manual: <code>manuals,
manual_sections</code> and <code>manual_figures</code>.  

<p>

<code>manuals</code> holds the name of each manual stored on
the system.  Additional information we keep includes the owner of the
manual and the scope of the document (public or restricted to a group).

<pre>
create table manuals (
	manual_id		integer primary key,
	-- title of the manual
	title			varchar(500) not null unique,
	-- compact title used to generate file names, e.g. short_name.pdf
	short_name		varchar(100) not null unique,
	-- person responsible for the manual (editor-in-chief)
	owner_id		references users(user_id) not null,
	-- a string containing the author or authors which will
	-- be included on the title page of the printable version
	author			varchar(500),
	-- copyright notice (may be null)
	copyright		varchar(500),
	-- string describing the version and/or release date of the manual
	version			varchar(500),
	-- if scope=public, this manual is viewable by anyone
	-- if scope=group, this manual is restricted to group members
	scope			varchar(20) not null,
	-- if scope=group, this is the owning group_id
	group_id		references user_groups,
	-- is this manual currently active?
	active_p		char(1) default 'f' check (active_p in ('t','f')),
	-- notify the editor-in-chief on all changes to the manual
	notify_p		char(1) default 't' check (notify_p in ('t','f')),
	-- insure consistent state
	constraint manual_scope_check check ((scope='group' and group_id is not null)
	                                     or (scope='public'))
);
</pre>


<p><code>manual_sections</code> holds information about the sections of
the manuals:

<pre>
create table manual_sections (
	section_id		integer primary key,
	-- which manual this section belongs to
	manual_id		integer references manuals not null,
	-- a string we use for cross-referencing this section
	label			varchar(100),
	-- used to determine where this section fits in the document hierarchy
	sort_key		varchar(50) not null,
	-- title of the section
	section_title		varchar(500) not null,
	-- user who first created the section
	creator_id		references users(user_id) not null,
	-- notify the creator whenever content is edited?
	notify_p		char(1) default 'f' check (notify_p in ('t','f')),
	-- user who last edited content for this section
	last_modified_by	references users(user_id),
	-- is there an html file associated with this section?
	content_p		char(1) default 'f' check (content_p in ('t','f')),
	-- determines whether a section is displayed on the user pages
	active_p		char(1) default 't' check (active_p in ('t','f')),
	-- we may want to shorten the table of contents by not displaying all sections
	display_in_toc_p 	char(1) default 't' check (display_in_toc_p in ('t','f')),
	-- make sure that sort_keys are unique within a give manual
	unique(manual_id,sort_key)
	-- want to add the following but can't figure out the syntax
	-- contraint manual_label_check check ((label is null) or (unique(manual_id,label))
);
</pre>

The sort key uses a system similar to that in the threaded bboard
system, whereby sections sort lexigraphically and the depth is
determined by the length of the sort key.  Ex.,

<ul>
<li>00
<li>01
  <ul>
  <li>0100
  <li>0101
  <li>0102
  </ul>
<li>02
  <ul>
  <li>0200
    <ul>
    <li>020000
    <li>020001
    </ul>
  <li>...
  </ul>
<li>...
</ul>

Unlike the bboard system, we only use digits since it simplifies the
code and 100 seems like a reasonable limitation on the number of
subsections of a given section.  While these are numbers, the database
treats them as strings and care must be taken to always single quote
sort keys in SQL statements.  Similarly, one should be careful to avoid
TCL's hangups with leading zeros.

<p>

<h3>Manual Administration</h3>

<p>High level administration occurs in <a
href="/admin/manuals/">/admin/manuals/</a>.  Here, administrators can
add or delete manuals, change owners, authorize editors or otherwise
dramatically alter the properties of a manual.

<p>Editorial tasks are handled in <a
href="/manuals/admin/">/manuals/admin/</a>.  Here the editor of a
manual can add, delete or edit sections of a manual and manipulate the
figures contained in a manual.

<p>The system uses CVS to provide support for multiple, simultaneous
editors.  This means that multiple editors can work on section content
at the same time without clobbering each other's changes.  Using CVS
has the added bonus of keeping a record of what changes were made and
by whom.

<p>Figure numbers are generated automatically based on the order they
are referenced within the sections of a manual.  This requires global
processing of the document and can be a relatively expensive operation
(compared to the executation time to construct a typical web page).
Figure numbers can get out-of-sync whenever figures are added,
removed, or rearranged.  A figure-numbering procedure runs nightly to
update figure numbers, but this can also be done on demand from the
admin page for a manual.

<h3>HTMLDOC</h3>

<p>We run a nightly proc to shove all the parts of each manual into one
big file then run HTMLDOC on it to generate PostScript and PDF
versions of the manual.  This is easy.

<p> The hard part is getting around how braindead HTMLDOC is.  First,
it requires a strict heirarchy for heading tags.  This is accomplished
by forbidding the authors from putting any &lt;H#&gt; tags by hand.  All heading
tags are generated on the fly at the appropriate level based on the
table of contents for the manual.

<p>It works out that this is not the only stupidity in HTMLDOC's
parser.  Things like
<code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;some&nbsp;text&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/u&gt;</code> also 
confuse it.  While most HTML editors are standard compliant in this
respect, it seems that MS Word really likes to produce stuff like
this.  I don't know of any solution to this other than strongly
encouraging authors not to use MS Word to generate their documents.
Since the HTML produced by Word is deficient in several other ways,
this probably won't be a big problem.

<p>Yet another fun aspect of HTMLDOC is that it seems to have some
problems with images if an absolute path is given, although I'm just
guessing here since this doesn't seem to be documented.

<p> Currently we are using HTMLDOC version 1.7.  The latest version is
1.8.4.  Possibly some of these problems are solved in later releases.
However, there doesn't seem to be a version history on their web page,
so the only way to find out seems to be to download the new version
and install it and see.

<h3>Figures and References</h3>

To handle figure and section references in an evolving document we
have developed a reference system which is an extension of HTML.  This
system allows authors to refer to images and sections without knowing
where the image is stored, where it appears in the text or what the
numbering of a particular section happens to be.

<p>Each section and figure has an entry in the database,
<code>label</code>, which is used to make references.  Instead of
using IMG tags, authors insert images with the tag

<p>
<blockquote>
    <code>&lt;FIGURE NAME=&quot;<var>label</var>&quot;&gt;</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
References to figures in the text use
<p>
<blockquote>
    <code>&lt;FIGREF NAME=&quot;<var>label</var>&quot;&gt;</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
A similar construct is used for referring to sections:
<p>
<blockquote>
    <code>&lt;SECREF NAME=&quot;<var>label</var>&quot;&gt;</code>
</blockquote>
<p>

<p> When a manual section is served, the above tags are replaced as
follows:

<p>

<table cellspacing=5>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><code>
      &lt;SECREF&nbsp;NAME=&quot;<var>label</var>&quot;&gt;
    </code></td>
    <td><code>
      &lt;A&nbsp;HREF=&quot;section-view?manual_id=$manual_id&amp;section_id=$section_id&quot;&gt;$section_name&lt;/A&gt;
    </code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><code>
      &lt;FIGREF&nbsp;NAME=&quot;<var>label</var>&quot;&gt;      
    </code></td>
    <td><code>
      &lt;A&nbsp;HREF=&quot;#<var>label</var>&quot&gt;Figure $sort_key&lt;/A&gt;
    </code><br>
    -or-<br>
    <code>
      &lt;A&nbsp;TARGET=OTHER&nbsp;HREF=&quot;figure-view?manual_id=$manual_id&amp;figure=<var>label</var>&quot;&gt;Figure $sort_key&lt;/A&gt;</code>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><code>
      &lt;FIGURE NAME=&quot;<var>label</var>&quot;&gt;
    </code></td>
    <td><code>
      &lt;A NAME=&quot;<var>label</var>&quot;&gt;<br>
      &lt;IMG&nbsp;SRC=&quot;$file_name&quot;&nbsp;ALT=&quot;<var>label</var>&quot&nbsp;HEIGHT=$height&nbsp;WIDTH=$width&gt;<br>
      &lt;P&gt;Figure $sort_key: $caption&lt;/P&gt;
    </code></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
with values pulled out of the database as appropriate.

<p>

When the text of a section is uploaded or edited, we parse the file to
look for any references which aren't already in the database.
References to nonexistant sections are not allowed and the user must
go back and change the offending reference.  References to unknown
figures send the user to a page where they can upload a figure from
their hard drive to the server.

<h3>Future Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Need to add CVS tagging so that a group of section revisions can be
associated with a particular "release" of the manual and old versions
of the manual can be retrieved on the fly.

<li>Need to add full-text searching of manual content.

<li>notify_p doesn't actually do anything
</ul>
