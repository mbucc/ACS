</ul>

This document describes the startup (bootstrapping) process for an AOLserver
running ACS.

<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

Before ACS 3.3, the ACS startup process was extremely simple:
after AOLserver performed its internal initialization (reading the configuration
file, loading shared libraries and module code, etc.) it scanned through the
Tcl library directory (generally <code>/web/<i>yourservername</i>/tcl</code>),
sourcing each file in sequence.

<p>While this overall structure for initialization is still intact, package
management has thrown a wrench into the works - there are a few extra things
to do during initialization, most notably:

<ul>
<li>Examine the ACS file tree for files that should not be present in ACS
(i.e., that were once part of the ACS distribution but have since been removed).
<li>Scan the <code>/packages</code> directory for new packages.
<li>Initialize enabled packages by sourcing their <code>*-procs.tcl</code>
and <code>*-init.tcl</code> files.
</ul>

This document examines in detail each of the steps involved in AOLserver/ACS startup.

<h3>The Startup Process</h3>

As soon as the
<code>nsd</code> daemon is executed by the <code>init</code> process (or otherwise),
AOLserver reads its configuration file and <code>chroot</code>s itself if
necessary. It then loads shared libraries indicated in the <code>.ini</code>
file (e.g., the Oracle driver and <code>nssock</code>), and
sources Tcl module files (generally in <code>/home/aol30/modules/tcl</code>).
This step is, and has always been, the same for all AOLservers, regardless of
whether they are running ACS.

<p>Next AOLserver sources, in lexicographical order, each file in the
<code>/tcl</code> directory. The first such file is <code>0-acs-init.tcl</code>,
which doesn't
do much directly except to determine the ACS path root (e.g.,
<code>/web/<i>yourservername</i></code>) by trimming the final component
from the path to the Tcl library directory (<code>/web/<i>yourservername</i>/tcl</code>).
But <code>0-acs-init.tcl</code>'s has an important function, namely
sourcing <code>/packages/acs-core/bootstrap.tcl</code>, which does the following:

<ol>
<li>
<b>Initialize some NSVs used by the core</code>.
These NSVs are documented in <code>/packages/acs-core/apm-procs.tcl</code> - no need
to worry about them unless you're an ACS core hacker.
</p>

<li>
<b>Verify the deletion of obsolete ACS files</code>.
The <code>/tcl</code> directory has evolved quite a bit over the months and years,
and a few files have come and gone. The
<a href="/doc/removed-files.txt"><code>/www/doc/removed-files.txt</code></a> file
contains a list of files which <i>must be deleted</i> from the AOLserver
installation, at the risk of causing weird conflicts, e.g., having several security
filters registered. <code>bootstrap.tcl</code> scans through this list, logging
error messages to the log if any of these files exist.
</p>

<li>
<b>Source <code>*-procs.tcl</code> files in the ACS core</b>.
We source each file matching the <code>*-procs.tcl</code> glob in the
<code>/packages/acs-core</code> directory, in lexicographical order.
These procedure are needed to perform any of the following steps.
</p>

<li>
<b>Ensure that the database is available</b> by
grabbing and releasing a handle. If we can't obtain a handle, we terminate
initialization (since ACS couldn't possibly start up the server without access
to the database).
</p>

<li>
<b>Register any new packages in the <code>/packages</code>
directory</b>. In each directory inside <code>/packages</code>, we look for a
<code>.info</code> file; if we find a package that hasn't yet been registered
with the package manager (i.e., it's been copied there manually), we
insert information about it into the database. (The first time ACS starts up,
<i>no</i> packages will have been registered in the database yet, so
this step will registers every single package in the <code>/packages</code> directory.)
Note that packages discovered here are initially disabled; they must be
manually enabled in the package manager before they can be used.
</p>

<li>
<b>Ensure that the <code>acs-core</code> package is enabled</code>. If the ACS
core isn't initialized, the server couldn't possibly be operational, so
if there's no enabled version of the ACS core we simply mark the latest
installed one as enabled.
</p>

<li>
<b>Load <code>*-procs.tcl</code> files for enabled packages</b>, activating their APIs.
</p>

<li>
<b>Load <code>*-init.tcl</code> files for enabled packages</b>, giving packages a chance
to register filters and procedures, initialize data structures, etc.
</p>

<li>
<b>Verify that the core has been properly initialized</b> by checking for the
existence of an NSV created by the request processor initialization code.
If it's not present, the server won't be operational, so we log an error.

</ol>

At this point, <code>bootstrap.tcl</code> is done executing. AOLserver
proceeds to source the remaining files in the <code>/tcl</code> directory
(i.e., unpackaged libraries) and begins listening for connections.
