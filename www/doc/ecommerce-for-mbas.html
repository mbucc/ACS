<h2>Ecommerce Subsystem (explained for MBAs)</h2>

of the <a href="ecommerce">Ecommerce Module documentation</a>
(this small part of which was written by <a href="http://photo.net/philg/">Philip Greenspun</a>)

<hr>

The big decision:

<ol type=A>

<li>you are the retailer

<li>you send all orders to one retailer

<li>you offer products and send orders to multiple retailers

<li>you let an arbitrary number of retailers come to your site and build
shops (Yahoo! Store; Amazon Z Shops)

</ol>

ACS supports the first three ways of doing business and will eventually
support the last one (clone of Yahoo! Store).


<h3>High-level features</h3>

If your imagination is limited, you can think of this as "Amazon.com in
a box".  Is is it impressive to do everything that Amazon does?  Not
really.  Ecommerce is a fast-moving field.  Packaged software always
embodies last year's business ideas.  The interesting thing is how
quickly one can extend an open-source software system to accomodate the
latest business ideas.

<h3>Bottom line</h3>

If a closed-source ecommerce package doesn't do exactly what you want,
you're out of business.  If the company behind a closed-source ecommerce
package goes out of business, so will you.  If the company behind a
closed-source ecommerce adopts a different "business model", you're
screwed.  

<p>

If you're even tempted to adopt a commercial ecommerce system from a
company other than IBM, Oracle or SAP (three enterprise software vendors
that seem likely to be around for awhile), read the iCat story towards
