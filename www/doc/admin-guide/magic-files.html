Magic Files

<hr>

You will probably want to customize all of the following files:

<ul>

<li><a href="/global/copyright.adp">/global/copyright.adp</a> explains the site's copyright policy

<li><a href="/global/server-busy">/global/server-busy</a> is served by AOLserver when the threads are
stacked up (presumably because the RDBMS is overwhelmed)

<li><a href="/global/file-not-found">/global/file-not-found</a> is served by AOLserver when the user
hits a non-existent URL; presumably this will contain some search tips

<li><a href="/global/unauthorized">/global/unauthorized</a> is served by AOLserver when the user hasn't
typed in a valid HTTP username/password (this shouldn't really ever be
part of the user experience since the ArsDigita Community System doesn't
use HTTP usernames/passwords)

<li><a href="/global/forbidden">/global/forbidden</a> is served by AOLserver when the nsperm system
isn't happy and refuses to say why (not sure why this should ever happen)

<li><a href="/global/error">/global/error</a> is served by AOLserver when it chokes on a Tcl
API program or CGI script 

<li><a href="/global/privacy.adp">/global/privacy.adp</a> is the site's privacy statement.

<li><a href="/global/legal.adp">/global/legal.adp</a> is the site's legal statement.

</ul>
