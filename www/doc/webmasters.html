This document contains instructions and pointers for the person who
makes publishing decisions on a site backed by the ArsDigita Community
System.

<h3>Setting up your site</h3>

First, decide which major modules of the ArsDigita Community System
you're going to actually use.  For example, you might say 

<ul>
<li>yes, we'll use the /bboard discussion system
<li>no, we're not going to have classified ads from /gc

<li>yes, we're going to track all clickthroughs from our site to others

<li>since we don't have banner ads, we're not going to use the banner ad
server 

<li>yes, we're going to use the member value system to bill people a
subscription fee every month

</ul>

You can realize these decisions to some extent by using the forms in
/admin/content-sections/ but also by editing any static  files that
you might have.

<p>

Second, decide how much moderation you want to do.  Generally, the
ArsDigita Community System allows anything to be commentable.  For
example, there are facilities to let users comment on a static 
file.  User A can post a news item and User B can comment on that news
item.  Any time that users are able to contribute content, you can
choose between three moderation policies:

<ul>

<li>open -- contribution goes live immediately; moderator may be
notified via email; moderator can revoke approval or delete the
contribution if he or she wishes.  

<li>wait -- the software solicits contributions from readers but doesn't
show those contributions to other readers until a moderator has approved
them

<li>closed -- the software does not solicit contributions from readers

</ul>

Note that these are configurable.  For example, in February 1999,
http://photo.net/photo/ had an open policy for /bboard, a wait policy
for top-level /news items, and an open policy for comments on approved
news items.  For policy configuration, have your programmer edit your
/parameters/ad.ini file and restart the Web server.

<h3>Editing standard files</h3>


Visit /www/global/ and edit the standard files that AOLserver (if
properly configured) will send for server error messages, file not
found, etc.  You might also want to take advantage of our predrafted
copyright and privacy.adp pages (you will have to work these into your
site).


<h3>Maintenance</h3>

Users hate dead links.  They will complain to you via email even if it
isn't your fault so you want to make sure that you at least get rid of
dead links in 

<ol>
<li>your static  content
<li>user-submitted related links
</ol>

The ArsDigita Community System contains automated tools to help you
check both potential sources of dead links.  Every few weeks, run
/admin/static/link-check to make sure that your static  files
don't contain embedded references to sites that no longer exist.  

<p>

For the user-submitted links, visit /admin/links/ and you'll find an
automated sweeper that checks every user-submitted link.  If a link is
unreachable on three successive tries (separated by at least 24 hours),
the ArsDigita Community System will ignore it in the future (though you
can still recover it from the database).
