<h2>Acceptance Test</h2>

for the <a href=index>Arsdigita Community System</a> 
by <a href="http://teadams.com">Tracy Adams</a>
<hr>

Use this to test an ACS installation. Going through these steps is also
a good way to learn the major features of Arsdigita Community System
administration.

<p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
You should ensure the database has been properly configured and that your
AOLserver installation will actually start.<br>
Suggested method:
<ul>
<li>Open up a sqlplus session as the Oracle user your AOLserver will connect
as.  We want to ensure we've completed the installation step of adding
NLS_DATE_FORMAT = "YYYY-MM-DD" to the Oracle instance init file.  Make sure the date format is set correctly.
<blockquote><pre><code>
SQL> select to_date('1-1-2000', 'MM-DD-YYYY') as y2k from dual ;

Y2K
----------
2000-01-01
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
If the date did not read "2000-01-01" that installation step failed.

<li>Next, make sure that the step of feeding Oracle the data model works.  In the same sqlplus session, make sure the <code>country_codes</code>, <code>counties</code>, and <code>states</code> tables were loaded:

<blockquote><pre><code>
SQL> select table_name from user_tables where lower(table_name) in ('country_codes', 'states', 'counties') ;

TABLE_NAME
------------------------------
COUNTIES 
COUNTRY_CODES
STATES
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>

If these three tables do not show up, we failed to properly feed Oracle the
data model.

<li>Spot-check that database objects created in <code>.../doc/sql</code> exist.

<li>If you installed site-wide-search make sure the im_convert PL/SQL proc is there.  This procedure converts a search string into a form interMedia understands to perform the search.
<blockquote><pre><code>

SQL> select im_convert('foo bar') from dual ;

IM_CONVERT('FOOBAR')
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
( { foo } NEAR { bar })*2.0,about(   foo     bar  )


</code></pre></blockquote>

If this is not what you see, then you likely failed to properly feed Oracle
the data model.

<li>Unless you have specified port numbers for both the ns_sock and ns_ssl (if
applicable) modules that are greater than 1024, you will need 
<code>sudo</code> permissions or root access for the following command.
As <code>root</code> make sure your server will start
<blockquote><code><pre>
/webroot/aol30/bin/nsd -fc /webroot/aol30/<yourservername>.ini -r /webroot
</pre></code></blockquote>
<p>
The <code>-f</code> option runs the server in the foreground, so you can easily see any errors that may have occurred when the server was run.  If you see any errors indicating the failure of a virtual server to start, this step failed.

</ul>

<h3>Template System</h3>

<p>Go to a number of pages under <code>/ecommerce/</code> and make
sure they get displayed with uniform style, e.g. <pre>
  index
   -> product-search
  shopping-cart
  gift-certificate-order
  gift-certificate-order-2
   -> gift-certificate-order-3
       -> gift-certificate-order-4
</pre>
(The style is defined in
<code>/web/<em>yourservername</em>/tcl/ecommerce-styles</code>).

<p>Note: this is the old template system, documented in <a
href="style">style</a>; the new one by <a href =
"http://www.arsdigita.com/intranet/users/view?user_id=86" >Karl
Goldstein</a> is not included in the ACS.

<h3>Categorization and User Profiling</h3>

You should be able to add categories, define their positions in
category hierarchy and, as registered user, choose content
categories you're interested in.

<ul>
    <li>Add new category 'scratch1' through category admin pages <a href="/admin/categories/">/admin/categories/</a>
    <li>Add subcategory 'scratch2' of 'scratch1'
    <li>Try to nuke category 'scratch1', system should return
        proper error message
    <li>Edit parentage of 'scratch2', remove link to parent 'scratch1'
    <li>Edit parentage of 'scratch1' and make it child of 'scratch2'
    <li>See if the categories are placed properly in hierarchy tree view

    <p>
    <li>In <a href="/pvt/home">/pvt/home</a> both categories should
        show up, check 'scratch1', update interest,
	then check 'scratch2' and update interests again
    <li>User interest changes should be reflected in user admin pages as
        well

    <p>
    <li>When tired of playing, nuke both scratch categories in proper
        order.
</ul>

<h3>Graphing</h3>

Stick this into a  file and then access it with your browser:

<blockquote>
<pre>
set legend [list "1997" "1998" "1999" "2000"]

set subcategory_category_and_value_list [list [list "Dog" "Favorite Animal" [list "45" "47" "40" "45"]] \
                [list "Cat" "Favorite Animal" [list "20" "21" "19" "21"]] \
                [list "Other" "Favorite Animal" [list "35" "32" "41" "34"]] \
		[list "Pizza" "Favorite Food" [list "34" "33" "35" "35"]] \
		[list "Chocolate" "Favorite Food" [list "24" "25" "24" "25"]] \
		[list "Other" "Favorite Food" [list "42" "42" "41" "40"]]]
               

ns_return 200 text/html "&lt;font face=arial size=+2&gt;Madrona Elementary School Annual Poll Results&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
[gr_sideways_bar_chart -legend $legend $subcategory_category_and_value_list]
"
</pre>
</blockquote>
It should produce a lovely four-color bar chart!


<h3>Ecommerce</h3>

After you have completed the setup tasks in <a href="ecommerce-technical">Technical Details of the Ecommerce Module</a>, here are some good tests of the things most likely to be broken:

<ul>
<li>Go to http://yourserver/ecommerce/ .  If the page is broken, it's because the data model wasn't automatically loaded with the rest of the ACS (the ecommerce data model is omitted intentionally to save publishers who aren't doing ecommerce from having a gigantic number of unused tables).  Solution: load the two files ecommerce.sql and ecommerce-plsql.sql with <code>sqlplus scott/tiger &lt; ecommerce.sql</code> (same for ecommerce-plsql.sql).  If you get an error while loading the data model, it may mean that you're not using Oracle 8i (required).

<li>Go to https://yourservername/admin/ecommerce/products/add (or http:// instead of https:// if you don't have SSL) and try to add a product without a picture.  If you get an error on add-2, it's probably because the directory to hold auxiliary product info cannot be created.
Make sure the directory (specified by the parameters EcommerceDataDirectory and ProductDataDirectory) exists.  By default, this is /web/yourserver/data/ecommerce/product/ .  Also make sure the permissions are correctly set (AOLserver has to be able to create new directories inside of this directory).

<li>Now try to add a product <i>with</i> a picture.  If it can't be created, that may mean that ImageMagick is not installed or is not at the expected path (/usr/local/bin/convert).

<li>Go to the customer service submodule  (https://yourserver/admin/ecommerce/customer-service/ -- or http:// instead of https:// if you don't have SSL) and add an interaction (if you get an error on interaction-add-2, that may mean the zip_codes table hasn't been loaded).   Use the email address of an existing user.  All the other information can be garbage.  Return to the main customer service admin page and find the issue you just created (look under Customer Service Issues).  When you're viewing the issue, click Send Email at the top.  Try sending email.  Possible problem #1: spell checker doesn't exist.  Solution: install spell checker (tools module).  Possible problem #2: can't send email.  Solution: install qmail on your machine.

<li>Go to http://yourserver/ecommerce/ and click on one of the products you just added.  Add it to your shopping cart and try to check out (using a real credit card).  If all has gone well, you will never see finalize-order (you'll be redirected immediately to thank-you), but if you get an error on finalize-order that may mean that CyberCash has not been correctly set up.

</ul>

Once all this is working, you can further test your system:

<ul>
<li>Follow the setup instructions in
<a href="ecommerce-setup">Setup of the Ecommerce Module</a>
<li>Go to the user pages at http://yourserver/ecommerce/ and place
orders, write reviews of products, join mailing lists, view your
account, etc.
<li>Return to the admin pages and do some maintenance (see <a href="ecommerce-operation">Operation of the Ecommerce Module</a> for details).
</ul>

<h3>Display Module</h3>

<ul>
<li>changing background color
<li>changing body text color
<li>changing color of the links
<li>changing color of the visited links
<li>changing the font type
<li>changing links display (underlined, non-underlined, ...)
<li>uploading logo
<li>enabling and disabling logo
</ul>

<h3>General Comments</h3>
Test tcl procedures used for adding comments to pages and test
general comments admin pages
<ul>
<li>adding a comment using <code>ad_general_comment_add</code>
<li>updating a comment using <code>ad_general_comment_update</code>
<li>displaying general comments using <code>ad_general_comments_summary</code> 
  and <code>ad_general_comments_summary_sorted</code>
<li>approving/disapproving a comment through admin pages
<li>editing a comment through admin pages
<li>deleting a comment through admin pages
<li>using dimensions on admin pages (sections, approving/disapproving, number of days)
</ul>

<h3>Help</h3>
Make sure that help links work and that appropriate .help files are used

<h3>Content Sections</h3>
Test content section admin pages

<ul>
<li>add a static section
<li>add a module (for groups having a complete module administration)

<li>edit section properties (section key, section pretty name, sort
key, help, intro)  
<li>enable/disable sections
<li>test view links on content-sections index page
<li>section navigation (make sure that correct navigation bars are generated)
</ul>

<li> Page layout is standard
<li> All inserts are immune to double clicks
<li> Links are all valid
<li> Everything is spelled correctly

<h3>Data Pipeline</h3>
Data Pipeline will be fully exercised by the Intranet module.

<h3>Simple Survey</h3>
You should test creating a new survey, editing a survey, enabling a survey, 
responding to a survey and viewing responses.

<ul>
  <li> Creating a new survey:
    <ul> 
    <li> log in as a simple survey administrator
    <li> go to /survsimp/admin/ and create a new survey
    </ul>

  <li> Editing a survey:
    <ul> 
    <li> log in as a simple survey administrator
    <li> go to /survsimp/admin/ and select the survey to edit
    <li> edit description
    <li> add new categories
    <li> insert new questions
    <li> change question properties: active/inactive, response required/not required,
    order (swap with previous)
    <li> delete a question; repeat this step after having responded to the survey
    and viewed the responses
    <li> go to /survsimp/ and check that the new survey isn't listed
    </ul>

  <li> Enabling a survey:
    <ul> 
    <li> log in as a site-wide administrator
    <li> go to /admin/survsimp/
    <li> enable the survey
    </ul>

  <li> Responding to a survey:
    <ul> 
    <li> log in as a regular user
    <li> go to /survsimp/
    <li> check that the new survey is now listed and select it
    <li> submit responses
    <li> respond again to the same survey and check your previous responses
    </ul>

  <li> Viewing responses:
    <ul> 
    <li> log in as a simple survey administrator
    <li> go to /survsimp/admin/
    <li> select the survey to check
    <li> view responses by user and summary of responses and check that your 
    responses were correctly inserted
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>WimpyPoint</h3>

<ul>
<li>Go to /wp and create a new, public presentation. Select "I'll provide my own" as the style.
<li>Create a fancy style with wacky colors. Verify that the color picker widgets work
properly.
<li>Add an image. Verify that clicking on the image filename displays the image.
<li>Go to the list of presentations. Verify that the presentation shows up.
<li>Edit the presentation. Add several slides with some attachments. Return to the
main editing page for your presentation by clicking your presentation's title in the
navigation bar.
<li>Click <i>Show presentation, viewing comments from collaborators and "edit" links</i>.
Make a comment or two.
<li>Log out. Go to http://<i>yourservername.com</i>/wp/ and view your presentation.
<li>Log back in. Click <i>Edit the presentation properties</i>, change a thing or
two, and save your changes.
<li>Bulk copy slides from one of your presentations into the current presentation,
and from a presentation belonging to another user. (Just follow onscreen prompts.)
Verify that the slides were properly added.
<li>Create a ZIP file containing several images (GIF, JPG, or PNG). Upload the
batch, verifying that the slides were properly added.
<li>Change the order of slides in the presentation.
<li>Click <i>Change people who can view/edit this presentation</i> and:
  <ul>
    <li>Make the presentation private.
    <li>Invite an ACS user to view and make changes to the presentation.
    <li>Invite a non-ACS user to administer the presentation (decide who gets to
view/edit it.)
  </ul>
  Ensure that both users receive emails, and that following the instructions in
  the emails gives them appropriate access to the presentation.
<li>Freeze the current slide set. Make a change to a slide. View the previous
(frozen) version of the presentation, ensuring that the change is not apparent
here. View the current version of the presentation, ensuring that the change <i>is</i>
apparent here. Revert to the original version of the presentation, ensuring that
the change has disappeared.
<li>Log out, ensuring that the public cannot see the (now-private) presentation.
<li>Log back in and delete the presentation.
</ul>

<h3>CRM</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to the admin page and add at least two states.
<li>Add some transitions. Try to pick conditions so that it will be
true for at least some people. Example: Users who have had some
activity in the last month: 0 < activity_since(user_id,
add_months(sysdate, -1)).
<li>Run the state machine a few times and see if any users move around
from state to state.
</ul>

<h3>Referer Module</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to some other web server, create a page with a link to the
server you are testing on. Click on that link a few times.
<li>Go to the referer admin page and see if your clicks were recorded.
You should see the foreign referral, but no local ones.
(Note: there's a cutoff so referers with only a few counts don't show. 
If you select a report for one day only, three clicks on the referring link should do the trick).
</ul>

<h3>Member Value Module</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the member value parameter section of the server.ini file is switched on .
<li>Go to a page which supports member value (e.g. delete a bboard message).
<li>Execute the page (e.g. actually delete a bboard message and charge the user for it).
<li>Go to admin pages, member value. Look at all charges. Your charge shows up there.
<li>Now accumulate enough charges, so that you surpass expensive threshold value
    defined in parameters file. Once you do your name should show up in the expensive members list.
<li>Go to http://hostname.com/admin/member-value/charges-all and click on a member. this should
    bring you to page http://hostname.com/admin/member-value/user-charges?user_id=x. on this 
    page charge member for 20. after you click the add button, this charge should show up on 
    the list of charges.
<li>On http://hostname.com/admin/member-value/user-charges?user_id=x credit the member with 
    enough money (specify negative value in the amount field), so that his overall value
    is bellow expensive threshold. visit expensive members page again -- the member shouldn't 
    be shown now on the expensive members list. 
<li>Make sure you switch the parameter off again after testing.
<li>If you stumble across an error on other pages related to member value, please inform the module owner, as he has no clue where the calls to member value are and will be used, as this is and will be the responsibility of every single module owner (this being a meta system).
</ul>

<h3>Education Module</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to /admin/education/ and create a new department.
<li>Go to the admin page of your new department.
<li>Add a user to the deparment.
<li>Add a subject to the department.
<li>Go to the admin page for the subject.
<li>Add a class under the subject.
<li>Go to the class's admin page.
<li>Upload a syllabus.
<li>Add an assignment.
<li>Add lecture notes.
<li>Go to the permissions page and make sure that there are values under
the roles (e.g. where it says Singular and Plural, there should be four
roles there).  If there are not, then the trigger that creates those roles
were not created properly.
</ul>

<h3>Glassroom</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add one each of: logbook entry, software module, procedure, service,
    host, certificate, domain
<li>From /glassroom, 'view' each entry by clicking on it's entry
    in each section (i.e. logbook, software modules, etc.) You should
    have a successful view of each page, then just back arrow to /glassroom.
<li>There is no /admin/glassroom section, and no delete function, so
    go into sqlplus and delete the entries from the glassroom tables.
</ul>

<a name="robot"><h3>Robot Detection</h3></a>

In order to test the Robot Detection package, we need to be able to
request URLs from the site with a <code>User-Agent</code> that is
listed in the <code>robots</code> table and see for ourselves that the
results are as expected.

<p>

The simplest approach to testing this is to add a
<code>FilterPattern</code> into the
<code>[ns/server/<em>yourservername</em>/acs/robot-detection]</code>
section of the parameters file and to add a record into
<code>robots</code> that matches a web browser program and use that
browser to access the site. The following SQL works for Microsoft
Internet Explorer 4.01 on Windows NT:

<pre>
insert into robots(robot_id, robot_name, robot_details_url, robot_useragent)
values('msie4', 'Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 (for testing purposes only)',
'http://www.microsoft.com/ie/', 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows NT)');
</pre>

Just be sure to delete this row when you go into production!
