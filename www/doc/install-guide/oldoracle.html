<h3>Installing Oracle 8.1.6</h3>

<ol>

  <li>Acquire Oracle 8.1.6 Enterprise Edition for Linux<p>
  <ul>
    <li> You can obtain the software from Oracle's TechNet (http://technet.oracle.com). Free registration is required. The latest version of Oracle 8.1.6 Release 2 for Linux. Via ftp, it can be found at:<p>

    <a href="ftp://ftp.oracle.com/pub/www/otn/linux/oracle8i/oracle8161_tar.gz">ftp://ftp.oracle.com/pub/www/otn/linux/oracle8i/oracle8161_tar.gz<br></a></li><p>

    <li> Note that the Oracle tarball that you will download is huge (&gt; 250Mb).  Oracle's site can be maddeningly slow at peak times. An alternative is to order Oracle 8.1.6 on CD-ROM (about $5).</li><p>

    <li> Oracle 8.1.6 now comes with a Java RunTime Environment built-in to the distribution, so you no longer have to downlaod and install it separately.</li><p>

    <li>After the download is complete, untar the file to a convenient location.</li><p>

    <ul>

<pre>
# tar -xzf oracle8161_tar.gz
</pre>

    </ul>

  </ul>

  <li>Things to Keep in Mind<p>

  Throughout these instructions, we will refer to a service name or SID of <b>ora8</b>.  Although we do not reccomend this for users not experienced with Oracle, it is possible to change this setting.  If so, change any reference to the Oracle Service Name or SID of <b>ora8</b> to your new name.<p>

  Do <strong>not</strong> change the name of the Oracle path, <strong>/ora8</strong>.  We reccomend this path setting for pathnames to your customized name.  If you are confused by this, stick to using <b>ora8</b>.<p>

  <li>Pre-Install Tasks<p>

  Though Oracle 8.1.6 has an automated installer, we still need to perform several manual, administrative tasks before we can launch it.  You must perform all of these steps as the <em>root</em> user.<p>

  <ul>

    <li>Open a terminal window type 'su -', and enter the <em>root</em> pasword when prompted.<p>

    <li>Create and setup the <em>oracle</em> group and <em>oracle</em> account.<p>
    We need to create a user <em>oracle</em>, which is used to install the product, as well as starting and stopping the database. <p>

    <ol>

      <li>In the terminal window, create the groups and users:<p>

<pre>
# groupadd dba
# groupadd oinstall
# useradd -g oinstall -G dba -m oracle
</pre>

      <li>Change the <em>oracle</em> account password<p>
<pre>
# passwd oracle
</pre>

      You will be prompted for the New Password and Confirmation of that password.<p>

    </ol>

    <li>Setup the installation location for oracle<p>

    While Oracle can reside in a variety of places in the filesystem, aD has adopted '/ora8' as the base directory to make our ACS installation that much smoother.<p>

    <b>Note:</b> the oracle install needs ~ 2 gigs free on '/ora8' to install sucessfully.

    <ol>

<pre>
# mkdir /ora8
# cd /ora8
# mkdir -p m01 m02 m03/oradata/ora8
# chown -R oracle.dba /ora8
</pre>

    </ol>

    <li>Log out of the <em>root</em> account.<p>

  </ol>

  <li>Set up the <em>oracle</em> user Environment<p>

  <ul>

    <li>Log in as the user <em>oracle</em><p>

    <li>Use a text editor to edit the <b>.bash_profile</b> file in the <em>oracle</em> account home directory.p>

    <li>Add the following lines to this file:</p>

    <ul>

<pre>
export ORACLE_BASE=/ora8/m01/app/oracle
export ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_BASE/product/8.1.6
export PATH=$PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:/lib:/usr/lib
export ORACLE_SID=ora8
export ORACLE_TERM=vt100
export ORA_NLS33=$ORACLE_HOME/ocommon/nls/admin/data

umask 022
</pre>

    </ul>

    Make sure that you do <b>not</b> add any lines like the following

    <ul>

<pre>
# NLS_LANG=american
# export NLS_LANG
</pre>

    </ul>

    These lines will change the Oracle date settings and will break ACS since ACS depends on ANSI YYYY-MM-DD dates.<p>

    <li>Save the file<p>

    <li>Log out as oracle<p>

    <li>Log back in as oracle and double check that your environment variables are as intended.<p>

<ul>
<pre>
$ env
</pre>
      <li>You should see all of the variables that we just typed in to the <b>.bash_profile</b>  above. If you don't, you probably made a typo. Go back to the file &amp; fix it.<p>

      <li>Make sure that<b> /bin</b>, <b>/usr/bin</b>, and <b>/usr/local/bin</b> are in your path (you should have seen them when you typed out 'env'.) If  they are not, then add them to the .bash_profile above. (that is, if you don't see /usr/local/bin in your path, add it by changing the PATH statement above to PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:$ORACLE_HOME/bin).<p>
    </ul>

  </ul>


  <li>Installing Oracle<p>

  <ul>

    <li>Log in as the user <em>oracle</em><p>

    <li>If your system is under console (text) mode, start X.<p>

<ul><pre>
$ startx
</pre></ul>

    <li>Find the 'runInstaller' script.<p>

    <ul>

      <li>If you are installing Oracle from a CD-ROM, it is located in the 'install/linux' path from the cd-rom mount point<p>

      <ul>

<pre>
$ su root
# mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
# exit
</pre>

      </ul>

    <li>If you are instaling from the tarball, the install script is located in the 'Oracle8iR2' directory that was cerated when you expanded the archive.<p>

    </ul>

    <li>Run the installer.<p>

    <ul>

<pre>
$ ./runInstaller
</pre> 

      <li>A window will open that welcomes you to the 'Oracle Universal Installer' (OUI).  Click on "<b>Next</b>".<p>

      <li>if your get an error, try the errors FAQ...<p><br>

    </ul>

    <li> Click &quot;<b>Next Install</b>&quot;, then &quot;<b>Exit</b>&quot;, then &quot;<b>Yes</b>&quot;.<p>

  </ul>

<li>Creating the first Database<p>

<ul>

  <li>In a terminal window (still as the oracle user) type:<p>

<pre>
$ dbassist &amp;
</pre>

  <li> The Oracle Database Configuration Agent will fire up. <p>

  <li> Select &quot;<b>Create a database</b>&quot;; hit &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;<p>

  <li> Select &quot;<b>Custom</b>&quot;, hit &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>

  <li> Select &quot;<b>Multipurpose</b>&quot;. hit &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>

  <li> Select &quot;<b>60</b>&quot; concurrent users. Hit &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>

  <li> Select &quot;<b>Dedicated Server Mode</b>&quot;. Hit &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>

  <li> Accept all of the options, and hit &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;<p>

  <li> For &quot;global database name&quot;, enter &quot;<b>ora8</b>&quot;. For &quot;SID&quot;, also enter &quot;<b>ora8</b>&quot; [it should do this automatically.] Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>

  <li> Accept the defaults for the next screen (control file locations.) Click  &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>

  <li> Go to the &quot;<b>temporary</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>rollback</b>&quot; tabs, and change the Size (upper-right text box) to <b>150</b>Mb. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>

  <li> Increase the redo log sizes to <b>10000K</b> each. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>

  <li> Increase &quot;<b>Processes</b>&quot; to <b>100</b>; &quot;<b>Block Size</b>&quot; to <b>4096</b> (better for small Linux boxes; aD uses 8192 on the big Solaris  machines.).<p>

  <li> Accept the defaults for the Trace File Directory. Click &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot;.<p>

  <li> Finally, select &quot;<b>Save information to a shell script</b>&quot; and hit &quot;<b>Finish</b>.&quot; [we're going to examne the contents of this file before creating our database.}<p>

  <li> Hit the &quot;<b>Save</b>&quot; button [use the default directory that it gives you. the file will automatically be called &quot;sqlora8.sh&quot;  and be in the directory /ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6/assistants/dbca/jlib]<p>

  <li> It will alert you that the script has been saved successfully.<p>

  <li> Now, look for the file &quot;initora8.ora&quot;, which should be in /ora8/m01/app/oracle/admin/ora8/pfile.<p>

  <li> Use your text editor to edit &quot;initora8.ora&quot;. We are going to add the following line to the end:<p>

<pre>
nls_date_format = &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;
</pre>

  <li> find the open_cursors line in the file, and change it to:<p>

<pre>
open_cursors = 500
</pre>

  <li> save the file.<p>

  <b>Note:</b> We suggest shutting down X to free up some more RAM and cpu cycles to give ocale as much breathing room as possible.<p>

  <li> change directory to: /ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6/assistants/dbca/jlib<p>

  <li> type: <pre>./sqlora8.sh</pre>

  <li> Your database will now be built. It will take &gt; 1 hour. No fooling.  You will see lots of errors scroll by (like: &quot;ORA-01432: public synonym to be dropped does not exist&quot;) Fear not, this is normal.<p>

  <p>Eventually, you'll be returned to your shell prompt. In the meantime, go get some food.<p>

</ul>

<li>Testing Your New Database<p>

<ul>

  <li> Make sure you're logged in as user oracle.<p>

  <li> Open up a term <p>

  <li> you need to download the &quot;Oracle Acceptance Test&quot; file. It's available at: <a href="http://photo.net/wtr/oracle/acceptance-sql.txt" >http://photo.net/wtr/oracle/acceptance-sql.txt</a><p>

  <li> Rename the file:<p>

<pre>
$ mv acceptance-sql.txt acceptance.sql
</pre>

  </ul>


  <li> Once you've got the acceptance test file all set, stay in your term and  type the following: <p>

<pre>
$ sqlplus system/manager
</pre>

  <li>Now that you're into SQL*Plus, change the default passwords for system, sys, and ctxsys to "alexisahunk" (or change them to something  you'll remember):

<pre>
SQL> alter user system identified by alexisahunk;
SQL> alter user sys identified by alexisahunk;
SQL> alter user ctxsys identified by alexisahunk;
</pre>

  <li>Now we'll create a new tablespace:

<pre>
SQL> create tablespace web 
     datafile '/ora8/m03/oradata/ora8/web.dbf' 
     size 50m autoextend on;
</pre>

  <li>and we'll create a user.<p>
  Typically we will name the account the same name that is used under /web/{service_name} to identify the service.<p>

<pre>
SQL> create user web identified by pw4web 
     default tablespace web 
     temporary tablespace temp 
     quota unlimited on web; 

SQL> grant create session, connect, resource to web;
</pre>

  <li>Next, quit out of SQL*Plus:

<pre>
SQL> quit
</pre>

  <li>Only load the site wide ctx stuff once or you will get errors on subsiqunt runs.


  Log back into SQL*Plus as user "web"

<pre>
$ sqlplus web/pw4web
SQL>@/[path to the acceptancesql file]/acceptance.sql
</pre>

  <li> The system will now churn for several minutes. This is normal.<p>

  <li> If there are no errors, then consider yourself fortunate. Your Oracle installation is working.<p>

</ul>

<li>Automating Startup &amp; Shutdown<p>

You will want to automate the database startup and shutdown process. It's probably 
best to have Oracle spring to life when you boot up your machine. <p>

<ul>
  <li>Oracle includes a script called <b>dbstart</b> that can be used to automatically
start the database.  Unfortunately, the script shipped in the Linux distribution does not
work out of the box.  The fix is simple.  Follow these directions to apply it.  First, save 
<a href="dbstart.txt">dbstart</a> to <b>/tmp</b>.  Then login as <b>oracle</b>.
<pre>
$ cp /tmp/dbstart.txt $ORACLE_HOME/bin/dbstart
$ chmod 755 $ORACLE_HOME/bin/dbstart
</pre>
  <li> While you're logged in as <b>oracle</b>, you should configure the <b>oratab</b> file
  to load your database at start.
  <li> Edit the file <b>/etc/oratab</b><p>

  <li> You will see a line <code>ora8:/ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6:N</code><p>
  By the way, if you changed the service name or have multiple databases, the format of this
  file is<p> <code><i>service_name</i>:<i>$ORACLE_HOME</i>:<i>Y || N (for autoload)</i></code>

  <li> Change the last letter from &quot;N&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;. This tells Oracle that you want the database to start when the machine boots.<p>

  <li> Save the file &amp; quit the term<p>
  

  <li>Now that you have a working script, you need to configure Linux to load it at boot time.
  You have to be <b>root</b> to do this.

<pre> 
$ su -
# cd /etc
</pre>

  <li> You need a script to automate startup and shutdown.  Save the <a href="oracle8i.txt">script</a> as <b>/etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle8i</b><p>

  <li> Open a term, as the root user. Make sure the script is owned by root and is executable:<p>

<pre>
# chown root.root /etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle8i
# chmod +x /etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle8i
</pre>
  <li> Test the script. change to the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory, then type:<p>
<pre>
# ./oracle8i stop
# ./oracle8i start
# ./oracle8i restart
# ./oracle8i invalid-parameter
</pre>

  <li> If it works OK, then you've got to add it to chkconfig:
<pre>
# chkconfig --add oracle8i
# chkconfig --list oracle8i
</pre>
</ul>

<li>Test the automation<p>
Reboot your computer and ensure that Oracle started automatically
by starting <b>sqlplus</b>.  If it works, then your Oracle installation is complete.
</ol>

<h3>Useful Procedures</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Dropping a tablespace<p>

  <ol>

    <li>run sqlplus as the dba

<pre>
$ sqlplus system/changeme
</pre>

    <li>To drop a user and all of the tables and data owned by that user:

<pre>
SQL> drop user <em>oracle_user_name</em> cascade;
</pre>

    <li>Drop the tablespace.  This will delete everything in the tablespace overriding
        any referential integrity constraints.  Run this command only if you want to
	clean out your database entirely.  

<pre>
SQL> drop tablespace <em>table_space_name</em> including contents cascade constraints;
</pre>

  </ol>

</ul>

<h3>Troubleshooting Oracle Dates</h3><p>
Oracle has an internal representation for storing the data based on the
number of seconds elapsed since some date.  However, for the purposes
of inputing dates into Oracle and getting them back out, Oracle needs
to be told to use a specific date format.  By default, it uses an 
Oracle-specific format which isn't copacetic.  You want Oracle to use
the ANSI-compliant date format which is of form <b>'YYYY-MM-DD'</b>.<p>
To fix this, you should include the following line in 
<b><code>$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/init<i>SID</i>.ora</code></b> or for the default
case, <b><code>$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/initora8.ora</code></b>:
<pre>
nls_date_format = "YYYY-MM-DD"
</pre>

You test whether this solved the problem by firing up <b>sqlplus</b>
and typing
<pre>
SQL> select sysdate from dual;
</pre>

You should see back a date like <code>2000-06-02</code>.  If some
of the date is chopped off, i.e. like <code>2000-06-0</code>, everything
is still fine.  The problem here is that <b>sqlplus</b> is simply 
truncating the output.  You can fix this by typing
<pre>
SQL> column sysdate format a15
SQL> select sysdate from dual;
</pre>

If the date does not conform to this format, doublecheck that you
included the necessary line in the init scripts.  If it still isn't
working make sure that you have restarted the database since adding
the line if you didn't do it prior to database creation.<p>

If you're sure that you have restarted the database since adding the
line, check your initialization scripts.  Make sure that the following
line is not included <p>
<pre>
export nls_lang = american
</pre>

Setting this environment variable will override the date setting.  Either
delete this line and login again or add the following entry to your
login scripts <em>after</em> the <code>nls_lang</code> line. 
<pre>
export nls_date_format = 'YYYY-MM-DD'
</pre>

Log back in again.  If adding the <code>nls_date_format</code> line
doesn't help, then let <a href="mailto:bquinn@arsdigita.com">me</a>
know about it.
