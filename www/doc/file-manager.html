<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

<p>The ACS File Manager is a simple tool for allowing content managers
to work on a site even if they don't access to the machine on which it
runs, via FTP or SSH login. Through the File Manager's web-based user
interface, text files can be edited using HTML forms, and new versions
of binary files like images can be uploaded, to replace prior
versions.  The set of files and directories that content managers are
allowed to work on can be configured in the parameters file.  If your
site uses version control, then File Manager will also take care of
recording all changes in the version control system.

<p>In addition to editing existing files, content managers can also
add new files to the system and create directories.

<p>The user interface looks like a file brower.  It uses the following
icons to indicate file status and type for various items under the
server's pageroot:</p>  

<blockquote>
<table>

<tr>
<td><img src=/graphics/file-manager/folder.gif></td>
<td>Folder</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src=/graphics/file-manager/text.gif></td>
<td>Editable text file</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src=/graphics/file-manager/image.gif></td>
<td>Editable image file</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src=/graphics/file-manager/locked.gif></td>
<td>Locked file, e.g. a file under version control with local modifications</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src=/graphics/file-manager/forbidden.gif></td>
<td>Forbidden file that cannot be edited or uploaded using File Manager</td>
</tr>

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>You can click on text or image file icons to see a preview of the
item, and you can click on file names to edit or upload new content.
Clicking on a folder will navigate to that directory and display its
contents.  Forbidden files cannot be operated on.

<h3>Version Control</h3>

<p>File Manager is fully integrated with CVS (the version control
system used by all ArsDigita development projects).  All CVS
transactions are handled by the <a href=/doc/version-control>version
control</a> module.  If you want to use version control in conjuction
with a remote repository, make sure you follow the instructions for
setting up access to a remote repository.

<h3>Permissions</h3>

<p>Keep in mind that all file operations (uploads, edits, creating
directories, etc.) are executed by the running AOLserver process.
This means that permissions are determined by the umask of the
corresponding account, usually nsadmin.  As a minor security check,
File Manager does not allow file names with /'s or spaces, making it
more difficult for users to create files outside of the server's
pageroot.

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p>The following set of parameters control the behavior of File Manager:

<blockquote>
<pre>
[ns/server/yourservername/acs/file-manager]
EnabledP=1
; use version control?
VersionControlP=1
; extensions of files that be can edited/uploaded using File Manager
Extensions=html,adp,jpg,gif
; directories to ignore
Ignore=admin,CVS
; directories to manage (relative to www)
ManagedDirectories=acs-examples,ads,graphics
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>VersionControlP</code> flag controls whether the <a
href=/doc/vc>version control</a> module should be used to record all
changes to files.  The <code>Extensions</code> parameter is a list of
file extensions that correspond to editable files.  The
<code>Ignore</code> parameter lists directory names that should never
appear in the file listing. The <code>ManagedDirectories</code>
parameter controls which directories will be accessible
via file-manager.  If you leave this parameter out then all
directories will be available.</p>

<h3>Future Improvements</h3>

<p>The ability to delete, rename, and move files and directories would
be nice, and perhaps set permissions.</p>
