<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

The General Permissions package lets you control who can do what with
each row in your database, by providing:

<ul>

<li><strong>an API for defining and querying permission rules</strong>
- Each rule grants a specific type of permission such as "read" or
"write" (i.e., the "what") on one row in the database to a specific
party (i.e., the "who")

<li><strong>a simple means to enforce those rules throughout the
site</strong> - One line of code at the top of each page identifies
the required permission and ensures that each user who attempts to
view the page has been granted that permission.

</ul>

There are five types of party to whom permissions can be granted:

<ul>
<li>An individual user
<li>Any user who play a specific role in a specific user group
<li>A specific user group, i.e., any user who is a member of the group
<li>All registered users
<li>All users, registered or not
</ul>

In essence, General Permissions treats rows in the database as
operating systems like Unix and Microsoft Windows NT treat files in
the filesystem.

<h3>The Data Model</h3>

The General Permissions data model is simple, consisting of one table:

<blockquote>
<pre><code>
create table general_permissions (
	permission_id		integer not null primary key,
	-- on_what_id is a varchar to accomodate non-integer ID's
	on_what_id		varchar(30) not null,
	on_which_table		varchar(30) not null,
        scope           	varchar(20),
	user_id			references users,
	group_id		references user_groups,
	role			varchar(200),
	permission_type		varchar(20) not null,
	check ((scope = 'user' and user_id is not null
                and group_id is null and role is null) or
	       (scope = 'group_role' and user_id is null
                and group_id is not null and role is not null) or
	       (scope = 'group' and user_id is null
                and group_id is not null and role is null) or
	       (scope in ('registered_users', 'all_users')
                and user_id is null
                and group_id is null and role is null)),
	unique (on_what_id, on_which_table,
                scope, user_id, group_id, role, permission_type)
);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

The <code>on_what_id</code> and <code>on_which_table</code> columns
identify the database row in question. The <code>scope</code>,
<code>user_id</code>, <code>group_id</code>, and <code>role</code>
columns together identify the party to whom the permission is being
granted. Finally, the <code>permission_type</code> column contains
values like "read", "comment", "write", and "administer" that
represent the actions you want to control. As with Unix, permission
types are independent of one another. One permission does not imply
another (e.g., "write" does not imply "read").

<p>

To define rules for who can insert new rows into a table, the
convention is to require "write" access on a row in the table's parent
table, e.g., in order to add contact information for a given user
(insert a row into the <code>users_contact</code> table), you need to
have "write" permission on the corresponding row in the
<code>users</code> table.

<h3>Enabling Users to Grant and Revoke Permissions</h3>

The page <code>/gp/administer-permissions</code> provides a reusable
interface for granting and revoking permissions on an arbitrary row in
the database. You simply link to this page from your own pages, making
sure to pass along:

<ul>

<li><strong><code>on_what_id</code></strong> and
<strong><code>on_which_table</code></strong> - the identity of the
database row whose permissions will be edited

<li><strong><code>object_name</code></strong> - the name of the
database row whose permissions will be edited; used only for display
purposes: in the page title, etc. (We name this variable "object_name"
because a database row typically represents an object of some kind,
and because "row_name" is not very intuitive.)

<li><strong><code>return_url</code></strong> - usually the result of a
call to <code>ns_conn url</code>, i.e., the page containing the link

</ul>

Consider the <a href="/doc/file-storage">File Storage</a> module,
which enables users to upload and store files on the server through a
web interface. To allow the user to edit the permissions of a row in
the File Storage module's <code>fs_files</code> table, here is an
example of how we could construct the link:

<blockquote>
<pre><code># assuming that $file_id contains the ID of a row in fs_files...
#
set on_what_id $file_id
set on_which_table "fs_files"

# use the value of the file_title column as the "object_name"
#
set object_name [db_string unused "select file_title
from fs_files
where file_id = $file_id"]

set return_url [ns_conn url]

set edit_permissions_link \
     "/gp/administer-permissions?[export_url_vars on_what_id on_which_table object_name return_url]"
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

Access to <code>/gp/administer-permissions</code> will be denied
unless the user has "administer" permission on the specified database
row.

<h3>How to Enforce Permissions</h3>

The page <code>/file-storage/one-file</code> (also part of the
File Storage module) displays all versions of a given file. To make
sure that we show the page only to users with "read" permission on the
identified file, we include a call to <a
href="/doc/proc-one?proc_name=ad_require_permission"><code>ad_require_permission</code></a>:

<blockquote>
<pre><code>ad_page_variables { file_id }

set user_id [ad_validate_and_get_user_id]



<strong>ad_require_permission $user_id "read" $file_id "fs_files"</strong>
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

Let's walk through this example step by step: First, we specify that
we expect to receive the identity of a row in the
<code>fs_files</code> table as a form or query string variable. Next,
we check the identity of the user and grab a database handle. Finally,
the call to <code>ad_require_permission</code> is self-explanatory:
"read" is the type of permission required and the combination of
<code>$file_id</code> and <code>fs_files</code> identifies the
database row that the user is attempting to access.

<p>

Internally, we first check to see if the user is logged-in. If so,
then the following questions are asked to determine if the user has
been granted the requested type of permission:

<ul>

<li>Is the user a member of the Site-wide Administration group?

<li>Has the user been granted the permission directly (i.e., a
<code>user</code>-scoped permission)?

<li>Does the user play a role within a group where that role has been
granted the permission (i.e., a <code>group_role</code>-scoped
permission)?

<li>Does the user belong to a group where all members of that group
have been granted the permission (i.e., a <code>group</code>-scoped
permission)?

<li>Has the permission been granted to all registered users (i.e., a
<code>registered_users</code>-scoped permission)?

</ul>

If the answer to all five of these questions is "no," then
<code>ad_require_permission</code> prohibits further processing of the
page by returning a 403 "Forbidden" error.

<p>

If the user is not logged-in, then we check to see if the requested
permission has been granted to unregistered as well as registered
users (i.e., an <code>all_users</code>-scoped permission). If not,
then <code>ad_require_permission</code> redirects to the login page.

<h3>The API</h3>

In addition to <code>ad_require_permission</code>, the Tcl API of
General Permissions provides the <a
href="/doc/proc-one?proc_name=ad_user_has_row_permission_p"><code>ad_user_has_row_permission_p</code></a>
predicate.

<p>

To access General Permissions data, you should use the <a
href="/doc/view-pl-sql?name=ad_general_permissions&type=package"><code>ad_general_permissions</code></a>
PL/SQL package, instead of SQL statements. (The Tcl API procs are just
thin wrappers on top of the PL/SQL package.) Here is a summary of how
to use the various procedures and functions in the package:

<ul>
<li>To check if the user has a specific permission, call
<code>user_has_row_permission_p</code>

<p>

<li>To grant a permission, call one of:

<p>

<ul>
<li><code>grant_permission_to_user</code>
<li><code>grant_permission_to_role</code>
<li><code>grant_permission_to_group</code>
<li><code>grant_permission_to_reg_users</code>
<li><code>grant_permission_to_all_users</code>
</ul>

<p>

e.g., <code>ns_ora exec_plsql $db "begin :1 := ad_general_permissions.grant_permission_to_users($user_id, 'read', $version_id, 'FS_VERSIONS'); end;"</code>

<p>

<li>To get the ID of a specified permission, call one of:

<p>

<ul>
<li><code>user_permission_id</code>
<li><code>role_permission_id</code>
<li><code>group_permission_id</code>
<li><code>reg_users_permission_id</code>
<li><code>all_users_permission_id</code>
</ul>

<p>

All of these functions return zero if the specified permission has not
been granted.

<p>

<li>To revoke a permission, first get the permission ID and then call
<code>revoke_permission</code>

</ul>

<p>

Note that the PL/SQL API (and therefore the Tcl API) is
<em>case-insensitive</em>.

<p>

One instance in which you may need to query the
<code>general_permissions</code> table directly is when you are trying
to answer a question like "What are the titles of all files in the
File Storage system on which I have administrative permission?" One
way to write this query is:

<blockquote>
<pre><code>select f.file_title
from fs_files f
where ad_general_permissions.user_has_row_permission_p
 (<i>user_id</i>, 'administer', f.file_id, 'fs_files') = 't'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

While this query is simple and readable, it has the unfortunate
side-effect of causing Oracle (8.1.5 and below) to execute a full
table scan of <code>fs_files</code>. (If function-based indexes worked
as advertised, then this would not be an issue.) So, if
<code>fs_files</code> were to become large, we would want to rewrite
this query with a join to <code>general_permissions</code> to keep
performance acceptable; see the implementation of
<code>user_has_row_permission_p</code> for what criteria that you
would need to make this work.

<h3>Future Enhancements</h3>

A high-priority enhancement of this module is to design and implement
a good scheme for default permissions, e.g., how do we know what
permissions to grant when a user creates a new file in the File
Storage system? The Unix <code>umask</code> concept is a simple model
from which we can start.

<p>

A possible extension to the data model would be to support dependency
rules between permission types, e.g., a way to say that granting
"administer" permission implies granting "write" permission, which, in
turn, implies granting "read" permission. It would be important to
ensure that this extension would be optional, i.e., that it would not
interfere with the current model, in which permission types are
independent of one another.
