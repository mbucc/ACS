<h3>The Big Idea</h3>

A publisher of reports or software would like to be able to ask "Who has
downloaded any version of Bloatware 2000?" or to say "Spam everyone who
downloaded Bloatware 2000 v2.3 and tell them to upgrade to the new
exciting 3.0 version".  Note that implicit in the foregoing is that
users must register before downloading.  A publisher might wish to
charge for downloading or limit downloading to members of a group.

<p>

You'd think that much of this could be accomplished with our standard
user-tracking stuff: <code>user_content_map</code> keeps track of which
users have grabbed which files; the member value system can store
charges for particular files (prices kept in the
<code>static_pages</code> table).  Some problems with using these
modules include the fact that it is tough to annotate or group files in
<code>static_pages</code> and the member value system is really more
intended for subscribing users who pay once/month

<h3>The Medium-sized Idea</h3>

For each file to download, we store

<ul>
<h4>in the <code>downloads</code> table</h4>

 
<li>download_id (unique key for a  particular download)
<li>download pretty name, e.g., "Bloatware 2000"
<li>directory name, e.g., "bw2000" (valid name for a Unix directory;
all versions of this download will be kept here)
<li>group_id (is this download associated with a user group?)
<li>a description of the item

<h4>in the <code>download_versions</code> table</h4>
<li>version_id (unique key for a particular version of a particular download)
<li>download_id (same for all versions of a prticular download)
<li>version (a number; larger is newer)
<li>pseudo filename, e.g., "bloatware-2000.23.tar.gz" (what you want it to
be saved as on the user's desktop)
<li>release date (don't offer until midnight on this date)
<li>status (promote, offer_if_asked, removed)


</ul>

<h4>Administration Setup</h4>
<p>

When the administrator decides to add a new downloadable file to 
the system, first the download directory must be created.  In the 
current version of the module, this takes the form of the "Add New
Download" function on the admin pages.  Doing this function only
creates the directory in which the downloadable files are stored.

<p>

Note that the directory into which the /download/ directory is placed
(generally /web/server_name/) must be write accessible to nsadmin.
This can either be accomplished by making the owner nsadmin or changing
the permissions so that nsadmin has write privileges.  Either way, if
nsadmin can't write to this directory, an error indicating that "Folder
<directory_name> could not be created" will result.

<p>

Actually placing the files in that directory is a second and 
seperate step.  To upload a file to the server, select the
directory name from the admin screens and then choose "Upload
New Version" command.  This allows the administrator to place
a file on the server that is downloadable by users.

<p>

As a side note, if the intended use of the Download Module
involves documents that can be opened by a program on the 
receiving machine (e.g. files of type .jgp, , .doc,
.pdf, etc.), then the AOLserver's .ini file (<em>not</em>
the ACS .ini file)  must be modified
to make AOLServer aware of these file types.  
This entry in the .ini file takes the form:
<pre>
[ns/server/servername/mimetypes]
.doc=application/msword
.ppt=application/powerpoint
.xls=application/excel
</pre>

<h4>User View</h4>

<p>

To regular users, the downloadable file is visible based on the 
assigned name assigned when the download directory was created,
combined with the version number.  This isn't always the most
obvious presentation of download filename, and will likely be
customized by applications that offer other than software
releases.

<p>

Downloads with a status of "promote" are offered on the top-level
/download/ page.  Downloads with a status of "offer_if_asked" are
available on a drill-down page of "/download/one" where multiple
versions of the same download may be offered.  Downloads with a status
of "removed" are only shown to the site or group administrator who has
the option of changing their status or looking at an old version.

<p>

Users can see all files available for download (even before registration). However, upon actual download request of a file, the system checks the user's registration status and the visibility  (e.g. "all", "registered_users", or "group_members") of the specific file and permits download accordingly (e.g. non_registered users are only allowed to anonymously download files with visibility="all", he is required to login otherwise). 

<h4>Implementation</h4>

<p>

Files and rows are never removed  from the database/system.  If someone wants
to upload a new copy of version 2.3 of Bloatware 2000, it gets a new
<code>version_id</code> and the old row is updated with a status of
"removed".

<p>

We keep a separate table of rules that will allow downloading.  The
rules can take the following forms:

<ul>
<li>unregistered users can download any version of download_id 37
<li>all registered users can download any version of download_id 37
<li>all registered users can download v2.3 of download_id 37
<li>members of user_group 2213 can download any version of download_id 37
(user group membership can be made subject to approval)
<li>users who have paid $X can download any version of download_id 37
<li>users who have paid $X can download v2.3 of download_id 37
<li>users who have paid $Y and who previously paid to download some
other version of download_id 37 can download v2.3 of download_id 37

</ul>

<h3>Under the Hood</h3>

The files to download are generally stored outside the Web server root
in a configurable location (by default /web/yourservername/download/).
We chose not to store the downloads in an Oracle BLOB column.
Downloads are presumed to be large and may require several minutes to
transmit to a user with a modem.  If we kept the files in a BLOB, we'd
have to either copy the data first into a /tmp file or hold onto an
Oracle connection for the entire download time.  For a typical site
configured with 8 Oracle connections maximum, this would mean that 8
simultaneous downloaders could wedge the service.

<p>

We keep metadata in an Oracle table and we use Oracle-generated keys as
filenames so there is no risk of conflict in the event of concurrent
updates of files to be downloaded (assuming there is indeed more than
one site administrator).

<p>

The directory structure bears some mentioning.  An objective is to keep
this browsable via Emacs and still have some idea of what is going on,
i.e., one should not have to also look into Oracle to verify what
versions of what downloads are available.

<p>

<ul>
<li>/web/yourservicename/download/bw2000/378.file is some version of
Bloatware 2000, published by the site owner, with version_id in the
database of 378.  A corresponding file
/web/foobar/download/bw2000/378.notes contains the latest information
from Oracle, e.g., what version it is, what the document is called, the
pseudo filename, etc.  A notes file is only for sysadmins to read.
The module never makes any use of informaiton in a notes file.

<li>/web/foobar/download/groups/78/8234 is version 1.0 of 
"How to turn your cubicle into an 8000-gallon marine fish tank", 
a document published by user group #78 (subcommunity of saltwater
aquarium lovers).  /web/foobar/download/groups/78/8234.notes 
contains ancillary info.

</ul>

<p>

Via clever use of ns_register_proc, analogous to the static file comment
attachment system (see /tcl/ad-html), we present URLs to the user
for final downloading that look like
/download/files/378/bloatware-2000.tar.gz (/download/files/ trips off
the ns_register_proc; after that the format is
/**version_id**/**psuedo-filename**).  This will result in their browser
defaulting them with a reasonable filename to "save as".

<h3>Legal Transactions</h3>

From the <a href="/admin/download/">admin</a> pages, the administrator can 

<ul>
<li>Add New Downloads
<li>Upload New Versions
<li>Add New Rules specific to a particular version/download 
<li>Edit Download/Version specific data 
<li>View Download History
<li>Spam people who downloaded a specific download /version 
<li>Remove a version / download both from the file storage and database 
</ul>

From the <a href="/download/">user</a> pages, the user can 

<ul>
<li>Download a specific version that he/she is allowed to download
<li>Input reasons for download
</ul>

<h3>Future Improvements</h3>

We have left the money stuff unimplemented in this version of the download module, although the data 
model supports"purchaser"/ "previous purchaser" user visibility.
It could be tied to a future version of the ecommerce module or be standalone.
