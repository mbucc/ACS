<h2>User Administration</h2>

In <a href="/admin/users/">/admin/users/</a>, as elsewhere in the ACS,
we try to follow the Macintosh user interface style:

<ul>
<li>pick the object, then
<li>pick the verb
</ul>

So we want to help the publisher pick up a group of users (the object)
and then pick something to do with those users (the verb).  Here's an
example:

<blockquote>

"I am interested in users whose email address ends in "mit.edu" and who've
either posted at least one entry in the last six months into a particular
discussion forum or who have explicitly said that they're interested in
learning more about large format photography.  Once I've seen how many
there are, I would like to spam them."

</blockquote>

As different installations of the ACS will have different active modules
and different publisher interest, we actually need a way for a publisher
to formally specify "these are the kinds of ways I'd like to select out
users".
