<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

We want a standard process for virtual project administration.


<h3>The Medium Picture</h3>

There are countless bug tracking systems. If fact, 
most developers have either coded at least one themselves 
or swear behind the feature set of one particular tool.
Remember, however, it is the process behind the system 
that is the key to success.
<p>

The need for structured communication heightens when clients 
and developers do not work in the same location.
Lack of a standard system is prone will result in a chaos caused by
a pile of emails intertwined with various phone conversations no one 
seems to recall in quite the same way...
<p>
<h3>The Cornerstone: Status</h3>

The status of bug or issue determines who is in control.  
Either the initiator or developer, but not both,
is in responsible for issues in each state. 
Typically, the initiator of most issues are the client.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Status = "Need clarification" ---> Initiator's responsibility</b>
<p>
The developer is stuck and needs instruction from the client.
The initiator should respond to issues and change the status to "open"
so work can continue.
<p>
<li><b>Status = "Fixed waiting approval" ---> Initiator's responsibility</b>
<p>
The initiator has the final say in what is acceptable and therefore
has the privilege of closing the issue.
The ball is in the initiator's  court to either close the 
issue or make a comment and reopen the issue.
<p>

<li><b>Status = "Open" ---> Developer's responsibility</b>
<p>
The developer is in charge of getting this issue done.  When the issue
is fixed, the developer makes a note and sets the status to "fixed waiting approval".
If the developer gets stuck, the developer makes a note and sets the status
to "needs clarification".
</ul>

<h3>Case study</h3>

<ol>
<li> Client enters an issue: 
<blockquote>
<i>Message</i>: The edit comment page doesn't work right.<br>
<i>Status</i>: <b>Open</b>
</blockquote>
<li> Developers assigned to the project receives an alert. The developer responds with a comment and changes the status:
<blockquote>
Comment: Please give a step-by-step outline describing what 
you are experiencing.<br>
<i>Status:</i> <b>Need Clarification</b>
</blockquote>

<li> Client receives an alert. Client adds a comment and changes the status.

<blockquote>
<i>Comment</i>: 
I logged in as myself. I was on http://arsdigita.com/vision.html .
I clicked on edit under my first comment. I changed the title from "I LUV
this vision" to "I love this vision" and pressed Submit.  When I looked at the page with all the comments, the change was not there.<br>
<i>Status</i>: <b>Open</b>
</blockquote>

<li> Developer receives an alert and fixes the issue. The developer adds a comment and a changes the status.
<blockquote>
<i>Comment</i>: I've edited /general-comments/edit-comment-2.tcl to update the comment
title in the database.  You should now be able to run your example successfully.<br>
<i>Status</i>: <b>Fixed waiting approval</b>
</blockquote>

<li> Client receives an alert and comes back to check. He decides that it is not quite right. Client adds a comment and changes the status.
<blockquote>
<i>Comment</i>:  Oh yeah, instead of saying "Submit", I'd like the button 
on http://my-service.com/comments/edit-comment.tcl to say "Edit Comment".<br>
<i>Status</i>: <b>Open</b>
</blockquote>

<li> Developer receives an alert and fixes the problem. Developer adds a comment and changes the status.

<blockquote>
<i>Comment</i>: I've edited /general-comments/edit-comment.tcl so that the button says "Edit Comment" instead of "Submit"<br>
<i>Status</i>: <b>Fixed Waiting Approval</b>
</blockquote>

<li> Client receives an alert, checks, and  decides he is satisfied.  Client closes the issue.
<blockquote>
<i>Status</i>: <b>Closed</b>
</blockquote>
</ul>
</ol>


<h3>Useful habits</h3>

<ul>
<li> Use the ticket tracker for all assignments and discussions.
Make projects to catalog different types of interactions such as "emergencies",
"ongoing", "discussions", etc.  This will build up a central source of documentation as well tracking assignments.
<p>
<li> Be careful to assign appropriate users to each project so they will receive email alerts as people add issues and make comments.
<p>
<li> Use the ticket tracker as replacement to sending email to each other.  
Entering or commenting on an issue will send alerts to the relevant people.
<p>
<li> Whenever you change a status, always enter a comment.  
Note URLs that have changed and files you touched. 
The project members will get alerted when there is something to view
and will know what to look for.
</ul>


<h3>Enforcing the law</h3>

This system only works if everyone uses it. 
In the beginning of a project, make an  
effort to teach clients and co-workers the process.
<p>
From time to time, the process will go astray.  You
will get a solitary email with some tasks.  This is
the time to reinforce proper use of the system.
<p>
You'll come to develop a style of your own to do this, but here are a few
templates to get you started.

Is there any reason we are not using the 
on-line collaboration system that we have been perfecting 
since 1994?  "The Book" 
(<a href="http://photo.net/wtr/thebook">Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing</a>) 
will give you an idea of  how ArsDigita operates in just 
17 chapters.

Please put this in the ticket tracker.

Thank you,

<li> Michael Yoon template:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Thank you for writing. I am confirming that I have received 
your email and I will investigate how  to fix this 
issue. I am sorry I haven't executed what you need and 
will try my best to rectify the situation.

Perhaps I can suggest that we use the ticket tracking system
that is set up your staff server.  I was thinking that this 
would allow you to see and comment on any questions or 
concerns you have about this issue at any time.

I've added this issue to the system for you and made sure it
appears as your entry. This will ensure you get  
automatic email responses of any notes that are made.

Just to be sure we are on the page, here is exactly what I did:
<ul>
<li> Going to http://your-servicename.com
<li> Logged in
<li> Clicked "ticket tracker administration" from the workspace
<li> Clicking "add and issue"
<li> Filled out the form with your instructions and hit submit
</ul>

Please take a look when you have a moment, and let me know if 
you think the user interface is sufficiently clear. 
Any suggestions on how to improve it are, of course, welcome.

Hope this helps,
Michael
