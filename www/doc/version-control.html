<p>The <code>vc</code> module provides an interface to the Concurrent
Versions System (CVS).

<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

<p> At this point we are all used to working collaboratively on site
development, and to using CVS for managing the code base as
the site is programmed.  But what about modules that provide access to
site content or software management tools?  Do we give up version
control in this case?  Do we have to rewrite the machinery of a system
like CVS?  Absolutely not!

<p>The <code>vc</code> module provides a simple interface to CVS that
can be used by any module to add version control capabilities.  It
also provides procedures to obtain version control information for any
file in the project, i.e. to display additional information in the
page footer or for integration with bug tracking systems.  Current
modules that use <code>vc</code> include the <a
href=/doc/packages>package manager</a>, the <a
href=/doc/file-manager>file manager</a>, and the <a
href=/doc/manuals>manual system</a>.  

<h3>API</h3>

The <code>vc</code> module does not have any user pages, just a set of
procs that allow you to access the version control system.  Every proc
takes the full pathname of a file to operate on.  The public API
consists of the following (all are direct analogies to the
corresponding CVS command):

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>vc_add <i>path</i></dt>
<dt>vc_log <i>path</i></dt>
<dt>vc_status <i>path</i></dt>
<dt>vc_remove <i>path</i></dt>
<dt>vc_commit <i>path message</i></dt>
<dt>vc_update <i>path</i></dt>
<dt>vc_checkout <i>module</i> <i>path</i>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>This last command (equivalent to <code>cvs co -d path
module</code>) is useful for grabbing a private copy of a file,
e.g. to support simultaneous editors in a content-management system.
The utility 

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>vc_path_to_module <i>path</i></dt>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p> will convert an absolute pathname into the corresponding CVS
module that it was originally checked out of.

<p>There are also a number of procs that simply grab information from
CVS either by exec-ing the executable or by reading the appropriate
version control information from the file system:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>vc_fetch_repository <i>path</i></dt>
<dt>vc_fetch_root <i>path</i></dt>
<dt>vc_fetch_status <i>path</i></dt>
<dt>vc_fetch_summary <i>path</i></dt>
<dt>vc_fetch_date <i>path</i></dt>
<dt>vc_fetch_revision <i>path</i></dt>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>An individual query can be relatively expensive, particularly if
CVS has to go over the network to access information from a remote
repository.  Therefore, all information managed by the <code>vc</code>
module is cached within the server based on the modification time of
the corresponding file.

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>To use the <code>vc</code> module you will need to set the
following parameters:

<blockquote>
<pre>
[ns/server/yourservername/acs/vc]
; Location of the CVS repository.  If the repository is on a remote
; host, you need to make sure that CVS can connect without being
; prompted for a password.
CVSROOT=/cvsweb
; Location of the CVS executable
CvsPath=/usr/local/bin/cvs
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The parameter <code>CVSROOT</code> is exactly the same as the
environment variable used by CVS.  The parameter <code>CvsPath</code>
specifies the location of the CVS executable.  If you are running a
chrooted server then the CVS executable must be located within the
restricted path of the server.</p>

<h3>Remote Repositories</h3>

<p>The <code>vc</code> module will happily talk across the network to a
remote repository, e.g. <code>CVSROOT=hostname:/cvsweb/</code> will
allow you to access the repository <code>/cvsweb</code> on
<code>hostname</code>.   The only connection methods currently
supported are <a
href=http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_2.html#SEC29>pserver</a>
and <a
href=http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_2.html#SEC28>ext</a> using
secure shell as the connection agent (strongly recommended).  For this
to work the user <i>nsadmin</i> (or whatever user account the
AOLserver binary runs as) must be able to connect to the repository
host without being prompted for a password.


<p>This is easy to set up and relatively secure using ssh with RSA
authentication.  We'll assume the server runs as <i>nsadmin</i>.

<ol>

<li> Login to the server host as nsadmin.

<li> Run <code>ssh-keygen</code> with no passphrase to generate
<code>~nsadmin/.ssh/identity.pub</code>.

<li> Copy <code>~nsadmin/.ssh/identity.pub</code> to the repository
host and append it to <code>~nsadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>. 

<li>Make sure the <code>authorized_keys</code> file has its
permissions set to 400 and that <code>/home/nsadmin</code> is set to 755. 

<li> Try logging in from the server host to the repository host using
<code>ssh -v nsadmin@repository-host</code>.  If you fail to connect
automatically, check the log output for some explanation as to why the
authentication failed.

<li> As a final test, try running <code>cvs -n update</code> from the
top-level directory of your project while logged in as nsadmin to make
sure that CVS can connect to the repository host correctly.

</ol>

<p>The most common problem is bad permissions.  If your connection is
failing then double-check the permissions on
<code>/home/nsadmin/</code> and
<code>/home/nsadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>.

<h4>chroot</h4>

<p>If you're running a chrooted server there are two more steps.
First, the <code>cvs</code> and <code>ssh</code> 
executables must be accessible in the restricted path.  Second, you
will need to copy the <code>ssh</code> configuration files into the
correct chrooted location; if you're following the standard layout
then:

<blockquote>
<pre>
cp /home/nsadmin/.ssh /webroot/aol30/.ssh
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, double-check the permissions as <code>ssh</code> is
extremely picky about this.

<h3>Future Improvements</h3>

<p>Might be nice to integerate with things like the ticket tracker or
general comments on a page.

<p>As written these procs are tied specifically to CVS, but they could
be extended to work with RCS or SCCS repositories, or any other
revision control system we might adopt in the future.</p>
