<h2>Developers Guide</h2>

to the <a href="index">ArsDigita Community System</a>

<hr>

This document contains general guidelines for building new ACS pages.
It should used in conjunction with <a href="procs">the procedure-by-procedure documentation</a>.


<h3>Writing a Whole Module</h3>

If you're writing a new module, see the short instructions in <a href="custom">/doc/custom</a>,
and a detailed guide in <a href="/doc/writing-a-module">/doc/writing-a-module</a>.

<h3>Documentation</h3>

Every procedure that you expect to be called externally (i.e., by Tcl
code that doesn't reside in the same file) should be documented with a
doc string.  Instead of using <code>proc</code>, you should use
<code>proc_doc</code>.  This results in <a href="procs">the
procedure-by-procedure documentation</a>.  If you're a new programmer,
you might want to read the <a href="common-errors">common errors
list</a>.

<p>

You call <code>proc_doc</code> with a string in between the args and the body:

<blockquote>
<pre>
proc_doc plus2 {x} "returns the result of adding 2 to its argument" {
    return [expr $x + 2]
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Magic Numbers in the Code (Parameters)</h3>

Don't put magic numbers in your code with site-specific stuff, e.g.,
whether a particular feature is enabled or disabled.  Add a parameter or
a section, if necessary, to your ad.ini file in the /parameters
directory.

Instead of 

<blockquote>
<pre><code>
proc bboard_users_can_add_topics_p {} {
    return 0
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

do 

<blockquote>
<pre><code>
[ns/server/photonet/acs/bboard]
; can a user start a new bboard
UserCanAddTopicsP=0
...

proc bboard_users_can_add_topics_p {} {
    return [ad_parameter UserCanAddTopicsP bboard]
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Naming</h3>

If it is a parameter, put it in
/web/yourdomain/parameters/yourdomain.ini and capitalize words, e.g.,
"SystemName" (for consistency with AOLserver .ini file).

<p>

If your define a Tcl procedure that is site-specific, name it with a
prefix that is site-specific.  E.g., the EDF scorecard.org site uses
"score_".  A site to sell khakis uses "k_".

<p>

If it is a community procedure, name it ad_ and put in somewhere in the
/tcl directory.

<p>

If it is a utility procedure, name it util_ and put it in the
/home/nsadmin/modules/tcl/utilities file.


<h3>Naming (files)</h3>

In general, we like to name sequences of forms in the following way:

<ul>
<li>foo (or foo.adp) -- presents a form to the user
<li>foo-2 (or foo-2.adp) -- presents a confirmation page to the user 
<li>foo-3 (or foo-3.adp) -- actually does the database transaction,
may redirect rather than present anything to the user
</ul>

As far as the "foo" goes (the actual name of the file), we like to use
object-verb.  So you might have "user-update" for a form that
updates a record in the <code>users</code> table.  Try not to be
redundant with the directory name.  So if you have a bunch of scripts in
a directory called "users", the script to look at one user would just be
"one" rather than "user".

<h3>Naming (columns)</h3>

The following column names are ArsDigita Community System standards.
<ul>
<li> creation_date  - date row was created
<li> creation_user - user_id of the creator
<li> creation_ip_address - ip address of the creator
<li> last_modified - date row was last modified
<li> last_modifying_user - user_id of the user last modifying the row
<li> modified_ip_address - ip address of the last modifying user
<li> html_p (t,f) -  is the text in html?
<li> approved_p (t,f) - is this row approved?
</ul>

<h3>Style Guide</h3>

Dynamically generated pages should always be signed with an email
address.  This should be the correct address for a user complaining that
a page does not contain the correct content.  Thus in general the
correct footer for a user page will be either <code>ad_footer</code> or
<code>gc_footer</code> or <code>calendar_footer</code>, etc.  Admin
pages should end with <code>ad_admin_footer</code>.  Then if the
webmaster encounters a bug or a page that doesn't do what is needed, he
or she can complain to a programmer.

<p>

If we're building a system where we can't get any better theories from
the publisher, we design pages to have the following structure:

<ul>
<li>title

<li>context bar (Yahoo-style navigation)

<li>HR

<li>out-of-flow options such as help or admin (aligned off to the right,
just underneath the HR)

<li>the meat of the page

<li>navigation and "more info" options

<li>HR

<li>email address signature 

</ul>

What about smaller style issues?  Here are some general principles we've
developed so far at ArsDigita:

<ol>

<li>don't smash stuff against the left margin of the page (hard to read,
esp. on screens crowded with windows); use BLOCKQUOTE or UL/LI tags to
put a white border between the left edge of the browser and the content
on the page.  Note that this also applies to tables of info.  BLOCKQUOTE
then TABLE.

<li>try to have no more than one form button per page and certainly no
more than one per form.  Some sub-issues:

<ul>

<li>you will never have a RESET or CANCEL button.  A user who mis-mouses
should not lose typed-in data.  If they change their mind, let them back
up, navigate away via the context bar, or reload.

<li>a SUBMIT button should never be called "submit".  It should say
something like "Create Account" or "Proceed" (if a multi-form pipeline)
or "Search"

<li>the submit button should be centered within the page, underneath the
table of form inputs

</ul>

<li>speaking of forms, if you have hidden or pass-through variables,
put them right up at the top of the form immediately underneath the FORM
tag.

</ol>

<h3>Using the Database Intelligently</h3>

Virtually every page on every site that ArsDigita has ever built (1) is
generated by a computer program, (2) has access to the relational
database that sits behind the site.  Take advantage of these facts.

<p>

How?  Follow two principles:

<ol>

<li>Show users as much information as quickly as possible; don't make
them click down

<li>Don't offer users dead links.

</ol>

These sound obvious but most programmers' instincts are to produce 
pages that behave like static  files.  For example, in a bond
trading site the top-level page might offer links to "portfolio,
trading, and open orders".  This could have been done with a  file!
Instead, why not query Oracle to find out the total value of the
portfolio (show users as much info as possible)?  Or query Oracle to
find out if there <em>are</em> any open orders; if there are just a few,
display them in-line, otherwise don't have a hyperlink anchored with
"open orders" (show as much info as possible; don't offer dead links).

<p>

In a photography classifieds page, don't show categories that haven't
any current ads (no dead links) and count up the ads in each category
for display next to the link (as much info as possible).  Isn't this
GROUP BY that sequentially scans the classifieds table kind of expensive
for a top-level page on a non-commercial site?  Sure.  But the solution
is to use <code>Memoize_for_Awhile</code> to cache results in virtual
memory.

<p>

Computer time is cheap; user time is precious.  Work the server hard on
behalf of each and every user.  Support the user with personalization.
Find out what is going to be down a hyperlink before offering it to the
user.  Buy extra processors as the community grows.


<h3>Give the User Dimensional Controls</h3>

See the /ticket module for how a large body of data may be rendered
manageable by giving the user several dimensions along which to select.

<h3>Pages that accept user input</h3>

Pages that accept user input should first call ad_read_only_p to make
sure that the Oracle database isn't being maintained in such a way that
updates would be lost.  Right at the top of a file that offers the user
a form or stuff something into the db, put 

<blockquote>
<pre>
if {[ad_read_only_p]} {
    ad_return_read_only_maintenance_message
    return
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

Systems should be designed so that a user clicking submit twice will not
result in a duplicate database entry.  The fix is that we generate the
unique primary key in the form or the approval page (better since it will
still work if the user reuses the form).  See the ecommerce chapter of
<a href="http://photo.net/wtr/thebook/">my book</a> for a discussion of
how this works.  See the news subsystem for a simple implementation
example.

<p>

Systems should be designed so that they do something sensible with plain
text and HTML.  Add an "html_p" column to any table that accepts user
input.  Store the user input in unadulterated form in the database.
Convert it to HTML on the fly if necessary when displaying (this
consists of guessing where to stick in &lt;P&gt; tags and quoting
greater-than or less-than signs).  See the
news subsystem for an example.

<h3>Pages that are broken</h3>

It is nice to email the host admin if things are wrong, but don't do it
directly with ns_sendmail; use ad_notify_host_administrator (defined in
/tcl/ad-monitor ).  This way, the host admin won't get email more
than once every 15 minutes.

<h3>Adding an item when some are present</h3>

Suppose that you have a page that has to (1) show a list of some items,
(2) offer the user the option of adding a new item of the same type as
the items being displayed.

<P>

Our convention in the ACS is to present the existing items in a list
(UL).  Then we have a blank line (P tag).  Then we have a new list item
(LI) with a hyperlinked phrase like "add new item".  


<h3>Content that can accept comments</h3>

In general, the purpose of Web content is to attract comments (see
Chapter 1 of <a href="http://photo.net/wtr/thebook/">my
book</a> if you aren't convinced).  That means whenever you're
developing a new application within ACS you should give users the
ability to contribute comments.  This is already a system feature for
static pages and the discussion forum.  For miscellaneous areas, such as
news and calendar, use this table from general_comments.sql:

<blockquote>
<pre>
create table general_comments (
	comment_id		integer primary key,
	on_what_id		integer not null,
	on_which_table		varchar(50),
	user_id			not null references users,
	comment_date		date,
	ip_address		varchar(50) not null,
	modified_date		date,
	content			clob,
	approved_p		char(1) default 't' check(approved_p in ('t','f'))
);
</pre>
</blockquote>

Note that it points to other tables via the on_what_id and
on_which_table columns.

<h3>Email Alerts</h3>

To avoid sending undesired email, use  the  <code>users_alertable</code>  view instead of the <code>users</code> table as a selection pool for generating alerts:

<blockquote>
<pre>
create or replace view users_alertable
as
select * 
 from users 
 where (on_vacation_until is null or 
        on_vacation_until < sysdate)
 and (deleted_p is null or deleted_p = 'f')
 and (email_bouncing_p is null or email_bouncing_p = 'f');
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h3>Distributing Maintenance</h3>

When distributing maintenance responsibility, use the <a
href="permissions">permissions package</a>.  See the /gc/ module
for an example of how this package may be used.

<h3>Auditing</h3>

Often a table will need to be audited, particularly if your client
has hired a number data entry people who are prone to make
mistakes.  Auditing a table allows you
to see who made changes, when the changes were made, what
changed, and the history of all states the data have been in (so
the data are never lost).

<p>

Auditing a table consists of:

<p>

<ul>
<li>Adding a few columns to the table to record the time of update
and the identity of the person making the update.
<li>Creating a separate audit table that contains all old versions
of the data in the table.
<li>Creating a trigger which automatically stuffs a row into the
audit table whenever the original table is modified.
</ul>

<p>

The ACS has a number of auditing conventions which you should follow,
as well as some utility procedures which can be used to display the history
of all states a table (or set of tables) has been in.  This is documented
in the <a href="audit">Audit Trail Package</a>.

<p>

<h3>Adding Graphics</h3>

If you want to add graphics to your site without performing major
surgery, the easiest thing to do is add <em>illustrations</em>.  That
is, put in pictures and drawings to give users a feeling of place.
Avoid making graphics and buttons part of the user interface.  It will
make the site hard to use for people on slow links.  It will make it
harder to maintain the code.  It will make it harder to offer a
text-only version of the site.

<p>

The two places on photo.net where there are decorations like this are 
up in the headline (turning it into an HTML table) and also alongside
lists of stuff.  Procedures that support this are the following:

<ul>
<li><code><a href="proc-one?proc_name=ad_decorate_side">ad_decorate_side</a></code> (in /tcl/ad-sidegraphics) 
<li><code><a
    href="proc-one?proc_name=ad_decorate_top">ad_decorate_top</a></code> (in
packages/acs-core/defs-procs.tcl)
</ul>

See <a
href="http://photo.net/bboard/">http://photo.net/bboard/</a> for a
demonstration of both in use.

<h3>Categorization</h3>

Suppose that you want to let each user manage a collection of items on
the server.  For example, at jobdirect.com, an employer searches among
tens of thousands of student resumes and can pick out especially
promising students to save for later scrutiny.  You know that at least
some users will pick hundreds of students via this mechanism and will
need some way to organize them.  However, new employer-users won't have
any students on their "favorites" list and it is unnecessary to expose
them to categorization machinery as they pick their first favorite
student.  Suppose that your categorization solution for power users is
one layer of folders.  When Joe Employer picks his first favorite
student, should he really be hammered with a message: "You haven't set
up any folders for favorite students yet.  Please set up a folder first
and then you can pick favorite students."

<p>

Remember Alan Cooper's adage that "No matter how cool your user
interface, it would be better if there were less of it."

<p>

We applied this principle on jobdirect.com by suppressing the
categorization machinery until the employer-user had picked at least 8
students.  Categorization then appeared as an option when the user was
viewing his or her list of favorite students (presumably this is the
only time when the user might have been thinking "hey, this list is
getting long").  Once the user had elected to switch over to the more
complex categorization interface, future picks of favorite students
would result in messages like "Oh, into which folder would you like us
to put this resume?"

<p>

For the advanced user, given that you're going to have categorization
you might ask how much is needed.  Users are familiar with the
hierarchical directory structures in the Windows and Macintosh file
systems.  Or are they?  Hierarchical file systems were lifted from the
operating systems of the 1960s and pushed directly into consumer's laps
without anyone asking the question "Are desktop users in fact able to
make effective use of this interface directly?"  The programmers who
built file systems needed an O(log n) retrieval method for files.  A
tree data structure yields O(log n) retrieval, so a file system has an
underlying hierarchical structure.  The programmers were too lazy to
develop any kind of categorization or database scheme on top of the
hierarchical tree so they just exposed the tree structure directly to
users.  So let's not invest too much authority in tree-structured file
systems.

<p>

Even if they have painfully learned to manage a hierarchy of files on
their desktop, do users want to manage another hierarchy on each Web
service that they use?

<p>

Do we need elaborate hierarchies?  Consider the user who has 1000 items
to manage but is very likely to want to work on the 20 selected or
uploaded in the last month.  Does this user need to wade through 1000
listings to find the 20 most recent?  No, not if we provide a "sort by
most recent" option.  Then the user can simply look at the top of the
page and not scroll down too much.

<p>

Can we survive with only one level of hierarchy?  I think so.
Especially if 

<ul>

<li>you provide ways to sort by creation or modification date within a
category

<li>you provide multiple hierarchies (e.g., by project, by subject)

</ul>


<h3>Searching -- is scoring better than a naive SQL query?</h3>

Suppose that you're faced with the task of letting the user search
through some data.  One way to go about this is to give the user the
ability to type SQL queries.  

<p>

User typing SQL queries?!?!?  Am I insane?  How could a random Web
surfer be expected to master the profundities of SQL syntax?  

<p>

Thus the average Web developer will typically build an HTML form to
shield the user from the complexity of SQL <em>while retaining all the
power of SQL</em>.  This form will have one input for every column in
the table, perhaps with some ability for a user to specify operators
(e.g., "less than", "equal to", "starting with").  The form will have a
select box or radio button set where the user can decide whether he
wants to AND or OR the criteria.

<p>

This approach shields the user from the trivial <em>syntactic</em>
complexity of SQL but directly exposes the far more brain-numbing
<em>semantic</em> complexities of SQL in general and the publisher's
data model in particular.

<P>

<blockquote>

<b>Bottom Line Principle 1</b>: the first search form that your user sees
ought to be a single text entry box, just like AltaVista's.  The results
page can explain how the results were obtained and perhaps offer a link
to an advanced search form at the bottom (on the presumption that the
user has scanned all the results and found them inadequate).

</blockquote>

<p>

Let's now consider the case of the user who fills out a multi-input
search form or types a long phrase into a text search box.  I.e., the
user has given the server lots of information about his or her
interests.  What is this user's reward?  Generally fewer results than
would be delivered to a user who only provided one query word or filled
in one field in the moby search form.  Compare this to AltaVista, Lycos,
and other full-text search systems that people use every day.  The more
words a user gives a public search engine, the more results are returned
(though oftentimes only the first 20 or 30 are displayed).

<blockquote>

<b>Bottom Line Principle 2</b>: the more information a user gives to
your server the more results your server should offer to the user.

</blockquote>

<p>

This principle seems dangerous in practice.  What if the user types so
many words that essentially every item in the database is a match?
Wouldn't it be better to offer an advanced search form that lets the
user limit results explicitly.

<p>

Very seldom.  Users are terrible at formulating boolean queries.  Most
often, they'll come up with a query that matches every row in your
database or a query that matches none.  You really shouldn't engineer
software so that it is possible for the server to return a page saying
"Your query returned zero results."

<p>

What's the way out?  Suppose that you could score every row in the
database again the user's criteria.  It would then be perfectly
acceptable to return every row in the database, ranked by descending
score.  The user need only look at the top of the page and may ignore
the less relevant results.

<p>

Is this a radical idea?  Hardly.  All the public search engines use it.
They may return tens of thousands of results if a user supplies a long
query string but the most relevant ones are printed first.


<blockquote>

<b>Bottom Line Principle 3</b>: Scoring and ranking and returning the
top scoring items is a much better user interface than forcing the user
into a simplistic binary in/out.

</blockquote>

Suppose that your users are giving you criteria that are more structured
than free text.  What's a good user interface?  On the search form, ask
for preferences but provide checkboxes to "absolutely exclude items that
don't meet this criterium".  On the results page, print items as
follows:

<blockquote>

<table>
<tr>
<td bgcolor=#EEEEEE>
<font size=-1 face="verdana, arial, helvetica">
<ul>

<h4>Items that meet all your criteria</h4>
<li>98: foobar
<li>92: yow
<br>
<br>
... 

<h4>Items that meet some of your criteria</h4>

<li>83: blatzco
<li>83: bard 
<li>82: cookie monster
<br>
<br>
... 

</ul>
</font>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>


<h3>Warning signs that you don't know SQL</h3>

Most Web programmers suffer from the delusion that they know SQL and
understand Oracle.  This delusion stems from the euphoria of getting a
Web page to work.  In reality, most Web programmers are very weak SQL
developers and the only things that save them are the incredible speed
of modern computers and the relative paucity of traffic on most Web
sites.

<p>

Here are some warning signs that you need to get help from a real SQL
programmer:

<ul>
<li>you've built a page that uses <code>lock table</code>

<li>you query Oracle for N things and then use Tcl code to filter out
some that don't fit your criteria for display.  I.e., you don't use all
of the data that you query from Oracle.  SQL is a very powerful query
language and, supplemented on occasion with PL/SQL or Java inside the
database, it is always possible to do your filtering inside Oracle
rather than dragging data across SQL*Net to filter in Tcl.

<li>you've built a page that queries Oracle for a list of stuff and
then, for each thing in the list, goes back to Oracle with another
query.  So if you had 1000 things on the list, you'd go to Oracle a
total of 1001 times for this page.  This kind of page can almost always
be slimmed down to 1 single query with an outer JOIN and GROUP BY.  You
might need to JOIN against an on-the-fly view.  In the worst case you
might need a PL/SQL procedure.

<li>you've gone into SQL*Plus and <code>set timing on</code> and
<code>set autotrace trace</code> and find that some of your queries are
taking more than a fraction of a second and/or requiring full table
scans.  Online systems should try to get everything done within 1/10th
of a second.  Remember that if your page takes 1/10th of a second you
can only serve 10 pages/second per processor.

</ul>

<h3>Sharing data among threads</h3>

The AOLserver <code>ns_share</code> construct is very slow in the Tcl
8.2 version of AOLserver.  We recommend the use of the much more
powerful <cod>nsv</code> facility, documented in
<a href="README-NSV.txt">README-NSV.txt</a>.

<h3>Filters</h3>

Use of <tt>ns_register_filter</tt> is deprecated as of ACS 3.2 - it's been
replaced with <tt><a href="/doc/proc-one?proc_name=ad%5fregister%5ffilter">ad_register_filter</a></tt>, a drop-in replacement which supports
some extra flags. <tt>ad_register_filter</tt>
provides the following functionality:

<ul>
  <li><b>Priorities</b> - filters are executed in order of priority (lowest number to highest).
For instance, the security filter (which must be run before anything else) has a priority of
1, compared to the default of 10000.
  <li><b>Monitoring</b> - using <a href="/admin/monitoring/filters">/admin/monitoring/filters</a>
you can see which filters will run for any given request.
  <li><b>Debugging</b> - invocations of the filter can be logged.
  <li><b>Error recovery</b> - if a non-critical filter throws an error, subsequent filters will
still be run (AOLserver's default behavior is to terminate the connection if any filter fails).
</ul>

<p>To provide this extra flexibility, ACS actually registers a single "&uuml;ber-filter"
with AOLserver and handles
filtering itself (in <tt>ad_handle_filter</tt>).

<p>You can use Perl to change all your legacy code to use <tt>ad_register_filter</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>perl -pi -e 's/ns_register_filter/ad_register_filter/g' <i>files-to-process...</i></pre></blockquote>

<h3>Scheduled Processes</h3>

<tt>ns_schedule_proc</tt> is also deprecated as of ACS 3.2 - use 
<tt><a href="/doc/proc-one?proc_name=ad%5fschedule%5fproc">ad_schedule_proc</a></tt> instead. <tt>ad_schedule_proc</tt> is <i>almost</i> a drop-in replacement (the
syntax for flags is slightly different, as the <tt>-thread</tt> and <tt>-once</tt> switches
require argumens -
see the <a href="/doc/proc-one?proc_name=ad%5fschedule%5fproc">documentation</a>. Using <tt>ad_schedule_proc</tt> lets you track which scheduled procedures are
about to be run and when (view <a href="/admin/monitoring/scheduled-procs">/admin/monitoring/schedule-procs</a>).

<p>You can use Perl to change all your legacy code to use <tt>ad_schedule_proc</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>perl -pi -e 's/ns_schedule_proc( -\w+)?/"ad_schedule_proc$1".($1 ? " t" : "")/eg;'` <i>files-to-process...</i></pre></blockquote>

This adds the necessary <tt>t</tt> after the <tt>-thread</tt> or <tt>-once</tt> flag (e.g.,
converts <tt>ns_schedule_proc -once</tt> to <tt>ad_schedule_proc -once t</tt>).
