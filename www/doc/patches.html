Any changes, enhancements or fixes that you make to the core ArsDigita
software should be logged on this page.  The information will then be
useful (a) when upgrading this installation to a new version of the ACS
(we'll know which files have to be customized), (b) when building new
versions of the ACS core distribution, we can pull improvements and
fixes from all of our installations merely by looking at
/doc/patches on each one.
