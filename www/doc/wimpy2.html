<h2>WimpyPoint II</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
This document outlines the design and implementation strategy planned
for improving WimpyPoint, including (in order of priority):

<ul>
  <li>Integration with ACS (e.g., fixing naming conventions and using ACS users).
  <li>Allowing authors to freeze presentations, and later view older versions
      of the presentation or revert to a previous, frozen version.      
  <li>Unlimited length for slide content.
  <li>Allowing files and images to be attached to slides.
  <li>User/group-based access control (ACL lists).
  <li>Implementing data mirroring (copying everything to a backup server
      nightly).
  <li>Allowing users to upload and maintain their own style sheets.
  <li>Allowing viewers to override authors' style information.
  <li>User-interface improvements in authoring mode.
</ul>

<h3>Data Model</h3>
The tentative new data model is available
<a href="sql/wimpysql.txt">here</a>.
It differs
from the old data model in the following ways:

<h4>Naming Conventions</h4>
All tables will begin with the prefix <tt>wp_</tt>. This provides
consistency with ACS and will ease migration (see <a href="#migration">Migration</a>).

<h4>ACS Integration</h4>
There will be no table specifically tracking WimpyPoint users - instead, we will use
WimpyPoint users and groups.

<h4>Access Control</h4>
The new <tt>wp_user_access</tt> and <tt>wp_group_access</tt> tables describe the set of privileges
available to particular users/groups with respect to a presentation. A user or group may
have

<ul>
  <li><tt>read</tt> access, allowing the user to view the presentation even
    if it is not public.
  <li><tt>write</tt> access, allowing the user (a "collaborator") to edit the presentation.
  <li><tt>admin</tt> access, allowing the user (an "owner") to change the ACL, invite
    collaborators, freeze the presentation, delete the presentation, etc.
</ul>

<p>An administrator can invite another user to collaborate (or co-own the
presentation) by adding him to the ACL list. (WimpyPoint will notify the
invitee via E-mail if requested.) If the user is not already an ACS user
(and thus cannot be added to the ACL), WimpyPoint will issue a "ticket"
(a row in the <tt>wp_user_access_ticket</tt>) which can be redeemed for
an ACL entry once the account is created. The ticket is protected by a
secret text string which is encoded into the URL sent to the invitee
as part of the invitation request.

<h4>Versioning</h4>
WimpyPoint will allow authors to freeze presentations,
causing the server to maintain a copy of the current state of the presentation.
To freeze a presentation we set a "checkpoint," causing WimpyPoint to make any future
modifications to any slide in a separate copy. The current checkpoint
ID for a presentation is stored in <tt>wp_presentations.checkpoint</tt>. Operations
on slides are handled as follows:

<ul>
<li>To obtain the most recent version of a slide <i>ss</i>, use a query like
<blockquote><pre>
SELECT *
FROM   wp_slides sl
WHERE  slide_id = <i>ss</i>
AND    checkpoint = (SELECT MAX(checkpoint) FROM wp_slides WHERE slide_id = sl.slide_id)
AND    deleted_in_checkpoint IS NULL
</pre></blockquote>
In other words, we select the row with the maximum checkpoint.

<li>To obtain the slide as it was when we set checkpoint <i>nn</i>:
<blockquote><pre>
SELECT *
FROM   wp_slides
WHERE  slide_id = <i>ss</i>
AND    checkpoint = (SELECT MAX(checkpoint) FROM wp_slides
                     WHERE  slide_id = sl.slide_id
                     AND    checkpoint <= <i>nn</i>)
AND    (deleted_in_checkpoint IS NULL OR deleted_in_checkpoint > <i>nn</i>)
</pre></blockquote>
Again, we select the row with the maximum checkpoint, this time subject to the constraint
that the checkpoint is <i>nn</i> or earlier (i.e., get the latest change before <i>nn</i>).

<p>Note that these previous two queries are not specific to querying for single
slides; for instance, to view the most resent version of an entire presentation <i>pp</i>,
simply change <tt>slide_id = <i>ss</i></tt> to <tt>presentation_id = <i>pp</i></tt> and
add <tt>ORDER BY sort_key</tt>.
<li>To modify a slide, we check and see if the current version of the slide has <tt>checkpoint</tt>
set to the most recent checkpoint for the presentation (stored in <tt>wp_presentations.checkpoint</tt>).
If so, we modify the slide in-place using an <tt>UPDATE</tt>; if not, a checkpoint has been set since
the last modification so we must create a new row in the <tt>wp_slides</tt> table referring to the
most recent checkpoint.
<li>To add a slide, we simply add a row to <tt>wp_slides</tt> with <tt>checkpoint</tt> set to the
most recent checkpoint for the presentation.
<li>To delete a slide (assuming that the current checkpoint for the presentation is <i>cc</i>):
<blockquote><pre>
DELETE FROM wp_slides
WHERE  slide_id = <i>ss</i> AND checkpoint = <i>cc</i>

UPDATE wp_slides
SET    deleted_after_checkpoint = <i>cc</i>
WHERE  presentation_id = <i>pp</i>
</pre></blockquote>
</ul>

<h4>Images and Attachments</h4>
Users will be able to upload images and attachments to display in
slides, either inline or with an explicit link.

<p>Users can upload attachments and images to be displayed inline (embedded
in the page) or separately. These are stored in a separate table
(<tt>wp_attachments</tt>) so that multiple versions of a presentation can
share them.

<h4>Styles</h4>
Style information is not limited to a CSS file name - styles will be
stored as rows in the <tt>wp_styles</tt> table. A style contains
a name, a description, CSS source (included inline when presentations
are displayed), and optionally an owner who can maintain the style.
Users will be able to upload images associated with their style sheets
(stored in <tt>wp_style_images</tt>).

<p>Individual readers can override authors' style preferences, e.g.,
if the reader prefers black text on white text because he/she needs to
deal with a finicky projector.

<h3>Implementation</h3>

Implementation steps:

<ul>
  <li>Migrate the existing code to the new data model (this includes
      ACS integration).
  <li>Clean up the authoring interface.
  <li>Add support for versioning.
  <li>Implement unlimited slide length and image/attachment upload.
  <li>Add access control.
  <li>Set up data mirroring (the backup server will run WimpyPoint,
      but with editing features disabled).
  <li>Implement the new style management system.
</ul>

It would also be very cool and useful to allow the user to download a tarball/zipfile
of an entire presentation
(<a href="http://intranet.arsdigita.com/proposals/admin/details.tcl?proposal_id=764&title=Improve%20WimpyPoint%20and%20integrate%20with%20ACS">thanks, Richard Tibbets</a>),
but this is really low priority.

<h3><a name=migration>Migration</a></h3>

All existing presentations will be migrated to the new data model.
We will write a script which:

<ul>
  <li>Creates an ACS user entry for each WimpyPoint user.
  <li>For each presentation in the old WimpyPoint, reads the
    presentation and slides and inserts the appropriate rows
    into tables in the new data model, mapping WimpyPoint users
    to ACS users, ownership privileges to ACL entries, etc.
</ul>

This will be fairly easy because the new data model is a functional
superset of the old data model.
