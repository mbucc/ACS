<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

<p>The existance of this repository is based on two facts.  One,
ArsDigita does not employ every talented programmer in the world.
Two, while incorporating every feature and extension used for any web
service into the ACS would make it bloated and unmanageable, people
shouldn't have to recreate the wheel all the time either.  Thus, this
repository exists to allow people to contribute code that extends the
ACS in useful ways which may be interesting and valuable to the rest
of the community of developers using the ACS.

<h3>Specification</h3>

<p>This repository will accept submissions of code to complement the
ArsDigita Community System (ACS).  These are pieces of code that, for
one reason or another, are not a part of the main ArsDigita releases.
This could be because the application is too specialized for the
general release, or because it is a modification to a version of the
ACS other than the current release, or even because it is a complete
module that wasn't written by an ArsDigita employee but should be
incorporated into the ACS in a future release.

<p>Technical issues will prevent this from being a CVS repository, at
least initially.  However, the value of being able to view the
evolution of a piece of work or of being able to access an older
version is indisputable.  For this reason, a version history of each
submission will be maintained and previous versions will be stored and
made availible in addition to the most current.

<p>Anyone may upload code they have written and anyone may download
any submission (as long as they are logged in to www.arsdigita.com).
The original submitter may specify that a piece of code is public,
meaning anyone may upload modified versions of the code, or limit the
power to make modifications to a group of individuals.

<p>The interface to the repository will be similar to the ticket
tracker.  We will provide controls to limit the display according to
the type of the submission (complete module, individual procedure,
etc.), the category of the submission (site administration tools, user
services, graphical enhancements, etc), how recently the submission
was made, etc.  The results will be sortable according to user
ratings, submitting user or any of the restriction criteria.

<p>The page displaying an individual submission will give information
about the submission, a version history, a link to download it, an
opportunity for users who have previously downloaded it to submit a
rating, and user submitted links and comments.  We will use the ticket
tracker to keep track of bugs and feature requests for submission.

<p>The storage scheme on the server is similar to the download module,
but simplified and human readable.  A submission gets stored as
/web/developer/extensions/shortname/shortname-version_name.tar.gz. 


<h3>Legal Transactions</h3>

<p>The user/admin dichotomy here is essentially that of download/upload.

<p>From the <a href=/extensions/>user pages</a> people can:
<ul>
  <li>View a listing of contributions, restricted and sorted by various
      criteria.
  <li>View a specific contribution, including documentation, a README
      file, version history, download statistics, comments and known bugs.
  <li>Download a contribution.
  <li>Submit a comment, rating, bug or feature request.
</ul>

<p>From the <a href=/extensions/admin/>admin pages</a> people can:
<ul>
  <li>Upload a new contribution.
  <li>Upload a new version of an existing contribution if they have
      permission to do so.
  <li>Specify a group of people allowed to submit modified versions of
      a piece of code owned by the user.
</ul>


<h3>Submissions</h3>

<p>Submissions require the following items to be uploaded:

<ul>

  <li>A text README file with a short description of the submission
  and instructions for installation.

  <li>The HTML documentation file that would go in the /doc/
  directory.

  <li>A tarfile containing these two files and, as appropriate for the
  type of submission, the SQL data model, any TCL library files, a
  section to be added to the server.ini file, all user and admin
  pages, and an acceptance test.

</ul>

<p>Submitters are strongly encouraged to provide the URL to an example
of the work in use.

<p>While there will be no formal code review of submissions (unless
the decision is made to roll them into the ACS), an attempt should be
made to conform to ArsDigita standards for comments, documentation and
naming conventions.


<h3>Future Improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Email alerts - awaiting general alerts module
  <li>CVS - maybe.  Unclear if it's really necessary.
</ul>
