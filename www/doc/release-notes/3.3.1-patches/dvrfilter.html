<h2>Using the form-variable filter</h2>

By David Rodriguez (dvr@arsdigita.com)

<hr>

<h3>What it does:</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The form-variable filter allows you to specify datatypes
for url variables. For example, you could specify that user_id
is always an integer, and if anyone passes in anything else,
the page will throw an error. 

<p>It's possible to restrict filters to certain url patterns,
which is necessary if you use the same variable name in different 
modules. For example, you could restrict $my_key to 
be an integer under /module_one/* and a character 
string when used under /module_two/*.

<p>The filters allows you to specify wild-card patterns, so you 
can specify rules like 'bboard_id is a character string, but all 
other *_id variables are integers.' 

</blockquote>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><tt>ad_set_typed_form_variable_filter <em>url_pattern</em> <em>list_of_variables_to_filter</em></tt>

<p><em>list_of_variables_to_filter</em> is a list of lists that
specifies (1) the variable to check, and (2) the datatype that we
expect.

<p><b>Examples:</b>

<p>Under /bboard/*, topic_id must an integer, and msg_id must be a 'word' 
(a string that contains only letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores.)

<blockquote>
<pre>ad_set_typed_form_variable_filter /bboard/* {msg_id word} {topic_id integer}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The default datatype is 'integer', which would allow you to 
write the spec above as</em><br>

<blockquote>
<pre>ad_set_typed_form_variable_filter /bboard/* {msg_id word} topic_id</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>Datatypes</h3>

<blockquote>

<table width=90% border=1 cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0>
<tr valign=top>
    <td><b>integer</b></td>
    <td><br></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
    <td><b>number</b></td>
    <td>Any real number. We check its validity by asking Tcl to do math with it.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
    <td><b>word</b></td>
    <td>A string that contains only letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
    <td><b>noquote</b></td>
    <td>A string that contains no single quotes. Use this when a string is allowed
    to have spaces, but not quotes. (Dates fit into this category.)</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
    <td><b>integerlist</b></td>
    <td>A string that contains only numbers, spaces, and commas (but no negative
    numbers, because this would allow people to sneak in math.)
    </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
    <td><b>safefilename</b></td>
    <td>A filename that doesn't contain '..' in it.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
    <td><b>dirname</b></td>
    <td>A string that doesn't have / or \ in it.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
    <td><b>fail</b></td>
    <td>The check should fail regardless of value.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
    <td><b>nocheck</b></td>
    <td>The check should pass regardless of value</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The <b>nocheck</b> operator is useful if you want to specify blanket rules,
then create a few exceptions. For example, if all the variables on the
site that end with _key were integers, except for $long_key, which
is a string that could contain any letter (including quotes),
you could write the spec
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ad_set_typed_form_variable_filter /* {long_key nocheck} *_key</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <b>fail</b> operator is used when you want to turn off access to 
a page by not allowing any url variables to be set.

<blockquote>
<pre>ad_set_typed_form_variable_filter /* {user_id_to_delete fail}</pre>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h3>What this filter protects against</h3>

<ul>
<p><li>Letting users sneak in queries where we expect integers.

    <blockquote>
    <p>Normal case:
    
        <blockquote>
        select .. from users where user_id = 5
        </blockquote>
    
    <p>Nasty case:
    
        <blockquote>
        select .. from users where user_id = <b>(select user_id where email = 'dvr@arsdigita.com')</b>
        </blockquote>

    <p>This bug can be patched using the <b>integer</b> data type.

    </blockquote>

<p><li>Not using QQ variables:

    <blockquote>
    <p>Normal case:

        <blockquote>
        select .. from bboard where msg_id = '000001'
        </blockquote>

    <p>Nasty case:

        <blockquote>
        select .. from bboard where msg_id = '<b>' || (select 'other' from dual) || '</b>'
        </blockquote>

    <p>This bug can be patched using the <b>noquote</b> data type (because
    any variable that can be used without QQing it should never have
    quotes in it).
    </blockquote>

<p><li>Letting users sneak in variables. For example, if you have
       code like:

        <pre>
        set user_id [ad_get_user_id]        
        set_form_variables
        </pre>

    then a user can masquerade as another user by passing user_id as a form
    variable.
    
    <p>This type of bug can be fixed using <b>fail</b>, e.g., make the page
    throw an error if someone passes in $user_id.
        
<p><li>... and other random errors. For example, the ACS contains
a registered proc over <tt>/general-comments/attachment/<em>some_number</em></tt>,
which uses <em>some_number</em> in a query. You can make this case secure using 
a filter with the type <b>third_urlv_integer</b>, which will throw an error if 
the third element in the url isn't an integer.

<p>(Read the documentation for <tt>ad_set_typed_form_variable_filter</tt>
to learn how to add special-case functions like this.)

<h3>Using the filter to secure your client site</h3>

<blockquote>
<P>There's one file, <b><a href=z-security-patch.txt>z-security-patch.tcl</a></b>, which contains patches to 
most of the known security bugs in a standard ACS installation
(as of midnight, July 3).  Put this in your /tcl directory.  It includes

<ul>
<li>a revised <tt>ad_page_variables</tt>
<li>a revised <tt>set_form_variables</tt>
<li>a revised <tt>set_the_usual_form_variables</tt>
<li>The new function <tt>check_for_form_variable_naughtiness</tt>,
which gets called from within the three functions above, 
and checks whether the variables being created are
of the right type, as well as running a few other
sanity checks (e.g., not allowing users to pass in QQ variables).
<li>The new function <tt>ad_set_typed_form_variable_filter</tt>
<li>The calls to <tt>ad_set_typed_form_variable_filter</tt> that 
will protect you against most of the 140 bugs that were found as of midnight
of July 3.
</ul>

<p>To secure custom code, you'll need to figure out which variables
in your code might be dangerous. Here are a few queries that might help.

<p>All your system's primary keys:

<pre>
    select 
        c1.table_name, 
        c1.column_name
    from all_cons_columns c1,  all_constraints c2
    where c1.constraint_name = c2.constraint_name
    and constraint_type='P'
    order by table_name, column_name
</pre>

<p>All the columns that end with _id.

<pre>
    select
        table_name,
        column_name,
        data_type
    from user_tab_columns
    where column_name like '%/_ID' escape '/'
    order by table_name, column_name
</pre>

<p>All the columns that end with _id that aren't numbers.
    
<pre>
    select
        table_name,
        column_name,
        data_type
    from user_tab_columns
    where data_type != 'NUMBER' 
    and column_name like '%/_ID' escape '/'
    order by table_name, column_name
</pre>

<p>All the columns that are numbers

<pre>
    select
        table_name,
        column_name,
        data_type
    from user_tab_columns
    where data_type = 'NUMBER' 
    order by table_name, column_name
</pre>

(The query that you really want is "show me all primary keys which
aren't integers," but the three-table join on system tables never 
returns.)
