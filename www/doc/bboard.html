<hr>

<ul>
<li>User directory:  <a href="/bboard/">/bboard/</a>
<li>Unified bboard directory:  <a href="/bboard/unified/">/bboard/unified/</a>
<li>Icons for unified bboard system:  <a href="/bboard/unified/icons/">/bboard/unified/icons/</a>
<li>Color swatches for unified bboard system:  <a href="/bboard/unified/colors/">/bboard/unified/colors/</a>
<li>Admin directory:  message deletion, etc., is handling by
admin-* scripts within the user directory; heavy duty stuff such as
creating a new bboard or adding a maintainer is done at
<a href="/admin/bboard/">/admin/bboard/</a>

<li>data model :  <a href="/doc/sql/display-sql?url=/doc/sql/bboard.sql">/doc/sql/bboard.sql</a>


</ul>

The discussion software supports the following kinds of user interfaces,
all of which query and insert to the same <code>bboard</code> table.
Currently the system supports:

<ul>
<li>Q&A format, developed for the <a
href="http://photo.net/photo/">photo.net</a> site and one of the most
refined interfaces

<li>Editorial-commentary format, developed for <a
href="http://cognet.mit.edu/">cognet.mit.edu</a>.  This is suitable for
when the publisher has longish thought-provoking editorials.  Readers
then submit commentary on this.  A big advantage of this format is that
the user interface isn't festooned with the words "question" and
"answer". 

<li>US-geospatial format, developed for <a
href="http://scorecard.org">scorecard.org</a>.  This allows messages to
be tagged with a zip code, county, or state.  So you can look at
discussion nation-wide, in a region, or limited to a zip code.

<li>original threads interface.  This is a lot like USENET and it
doesn't scale very well as the discussion accumulates threads.

</ul>

<h3>File upload</h3>

Users can upload one file in association with any message.  This was
developed to facilitate photo uploading.  There is only one extra table
defined for 

<blockquote>
<pre><code>
create sequence bboard_upload_id_sequence;

create table bboard_uploaded_files (
	bboard_upload_id	integer primary key,
	msg_id			not null references bboard,
	file_type		varchar(100),	-- e.g., "photo"
	file_extension		varchar(50), 	-- e.g., "jpg"
	-- can be useful when deciding whether to present all of something
	n_bytes			integer,
	-- generally the filename will be "*msg_id*-*upload_id*.extension"
	-- where the extension was the originally provided (so 
	-- that ns_guesstype will work)
	filename_stub		varchar(200) not null,
	-- fields that only make sense if this is an image
	caption			varchar(4000),
	-- will be null if the photo was small to begin with
	thumbnail_stub		varchar(200),
	original_width		integer,
	original_height		integer
);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Permissions Model</h3>

[The bboard module was upgraded around time of version 2.1 to use the
comon ACS user/groups administrative API]

<p>

Goal: To allow per-group bboards, and to use the new ACS permissions
system to control user and administrative access to the bboards.

<p>
Each bboard topic is now associated with an administrative group,
created using ad_administration_group_add, with "bboard" as the module
and the topic_id as the sub-module. Any users who have been added to
the corresponding administration group by
ad_administration_group_user_add will have administrative access to
the topic. They can access the bboard/admin-xxx pages, and moderate
discussions on the topic.

<h4>Public and Private Bboards</h4>

All permissioning is done at the topic level.  A message inherits its
private/public status from the topic of which it is part.  A topic has
"read-access" and "write-access" permissions.

<pre>
Read-access := any | public | group

 any    :=  topic may be viewed by any user of the system
 public :=  topic may only be view by a registered user of the system
 group  :=  topic may only be viewed by members of the topic's group(s)

Write-access :=  public | group

 public := any registered user may post a message or reply
 group  := only members of the topic's group(s) may post or reply to messages

</pre>

<h4>Urgent requests</h4>
<ul>
 <li>data model: an additional column <tt>urgent_p</tt> which says if 
the posting is urgent or not
 <li>parameters: <tt>UrgentMessageEnabledP=<i>[0|1]</i></tt>, <tt>DaysConsideredUrgent=<i>number-of-days</i></tt> in
the <tt>bboard</tt> section of the config file.

</ul>

<h3>Future Versions</h3>

<ul>

<li>kill off the /bboard/unified/colors directory and come up with a
system that lets people choose simply with HTML standard color palette
(keywords from the server; let the browser render the colors).
