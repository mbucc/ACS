Use Ansible to build an Arsdigita Community Server.
Created: Tue Aug 20 19:14:30 EDT 2013

Status

    Provisions functional system:
        * Arsdigita Community System (version 3.4.10)
        * AOLServer 3.5.11
        * Oracle Express 11.2g
        * Oracle Linux 5, 64bit

    KNOWN ISSUES:

        * Search is not working.

        * SSL not working.

        * ecommerce module is not installed.

        * The playbooks are clumsy about idempotency, especially
          around database stuff.

        * The ACS parameter file needs some love.

        * Inserts and updates to a table with a CLOB column is 
          probably going to fail with an ORA-24816.  So far, I 
          have fixed surveys and the TCL package management.

    TODO:

        * Configure system so AOL (and ACS?) man pages are on MANPATH.

        * Fix backup to use Oracle Express backup script.

        * AOL Server is consistently a royal pain in the ass.  Take 
          a look at https://bitbucket.org/naviserver/naviserver (in
          particular, http://wiki.tcl.tk/22567).

Setup

    1. Install Oracle Linux 5 64bit.

    2. Install simple json package with yum.

    3. Get sources:

        a. Download RPM for Oracle Express 11.2 
           oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm

        b. Run ./acs_get.sh

        c. Run ./aol_get.sh

    4. Adjust *_vars.yml files to your liking.

    5. Run: ansible-playbook playbook.yml.

        $ ansible-playbook -v playbook.yml

          WARNING: If you have ACS data, it may be deleted.
                   (The idempotency of the SQL in the ansible play
                   books is a work in progress.)


Oracle Licensing

    For a web app, you need to buy the per-cpu (Named users is every
    user, not every application connection.)  The lowest per CPU
    license is over $1,100.

    So use Oracle Express.  It's free to use in production for one
    CPU and up to 11GB of user data.  The base ACS install only
    takes 20MB of user data (0.2% of this quota). Once I hit to 2
    or 3 GB of user data, I'll look into using PostgreSQL.

      Oracle Linux.  Considered Ubuntu, but it looked non-trivial to run Oracle there.
