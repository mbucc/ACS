This document covers the installation of the ArsDigita Community System (ACS)
step by step.  It assumes that you have already installed <a href="oracle.html">Oracle</a>
 and <a href="aolserver.html">AOLServer</a>.

  <a name="download"></a>
  <h3>Downloading the ACS.</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Download the following components from the ArsDigita 
      <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/download/" >download</a> 
       page to the <b>/tmp</b> directory:<p>
  <ul>

    <li>ArsDigita Community System v 3.3.<p>

  </ul>
  
  <li>Login as nsadmin and uncompress the downloaded components into
      <code>/web</code>.
      Substitute the correct file 
name into the line below.  If you type <code>acs-</code> and then press 
the <b>TAB</b> key, your shell should complete the file name for you.  <p>
<pre>
$ su - nsadmin
; Enter nsadmin's password.
$ cd /tmp
$ tar -xzvf acs-3.3.tar.gz --directory=/web

; Stay logged in as <b>nsadmin</b>.
</pre>

    <li>You should now have a <em>acs</em> directory tree in <b>/web</b>.  Rename
    this directory to whatever you want your web service to be identified as.
    The name of your web service is referred as the <em>service_name</em>.  This identification
    is used internally by AOLServer to differentiate your services from one another.  A service
    name should be a single word <em>letters and numbers only</em>.  If the name of your site is one word,
    that would be a good choice.   For example "arfdigita" is the service name for the <a href="http://arfdigita.org/">ArfDigita.org</a> community.
<pre>
$ cd /web
$ mv acs <em>service_name</em>
</pre>
<li>
The ACS is configured by a single parameter file which is always
    stored in <code>/web/service_name/parameters/</code>.  The name
    of the  configuration file is not important, as long as it is not
    <code>ad.ini</code>.  This is the name of the default file shipped
    with the ACS.  Make a copy of this file and modify it to taste.
    You do not need to delete <code>ad.ini</code>.
<pre>
$ cd /web/<em>service_name</em>/parameters
$ cp ad.ini <em>service_name</em>.ini
Open <em>service_name</em>.ini your favorite editor.
</pre>
  
Use a text replace command to replace instances of "yourservername"
    with <em>service_name</em>.  You should also scan the file
    and replace items such as 
    "yourdomain Network" with a more appropriate setting.  Consider
    at least setting the system name, the publisher name, and the email
    address
    of the system owner.  You should also set all e-mail addresses to an
    actual e-mail account that can receive mail.  Many pages
    display the system name at the top, so you should set this as well.
    You can revisit this file at any time to update the configuration.
 </ul><p>
<a name="prepare"></a>
<a href="#top">TOP</a><br><h3>Prepare Oracle for ACS</h3>
    You should be logged on as <b>nsadmin</b> for this step and you
    should make sure that <b>nsadmin</b> is in the <b>dba</b> group.
<ul>
  <li>
 Verify this by typing <b>groups</b> when you login.
    <pre>
$ groups
nsadmin dba web
</pre>

If you do not see these groups, take the following action:
<pre>
$ su -		# enter root password
# usermod -g nsadmin -G dba,web nsadmin
</pre>

If you get an error about an undefined group, then add that group
manually.
<pre>
# groupadd dba
# groupadd nsadmin
# groupadd web
</pre>

Make sure to logout as <code>root</code> when you are finished with this
 step and log back in as <code>nsadmin</code>.
<p>

  <li>Connect to Oracle using <code>svrmgrl</code> and login.<p>
<pre>
$ svrmgrl

SVRMGR> connect internal
Connected.
</pre>

    <li>Determine where the system tablespaces are stored
<pre>
SVRMGR>  select file_name from dba_data_files;
</pre>
Example results:
<pre>
/ora8/m01/app/oracle/oradata/ora8/system01.dbf
/ora8/m01/app/oracle/oradata/ora8/tools01.dbf
/ora8/m01/app/oracle/oradata/ora8/rbs01.dbf
/ora8/m01/app/oracle/oradata/ora8/temp01.dbf
/ora8/m01/app/oracle/oradata/ora8/users01.dbf
/ora8/m01/app/oracle/oradata/ora8/indx01.dbf
/ora8/m01/app/oracle/oradata/ora8/drsys01.dbf
</pre>

<li>Using the above output, you should determine where to store your 
tablespace.  As a general rule, you'll want to store your tablespace on a 
separate mount point under the <code>/ora8</code> directory that is
 
 separate from the Oracle system data files.  By default, the Oracle
    system is on <code>m01</code>, so we will use <code>m02</code>.  This will enable you to
separate your Oracle system and database files onto separate disks for
optimized performance.  For more information on such a configuration, 
see <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/books/panda/databases-choosing">Chapter
12</a> of <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/books/panda/">the book</a>.
For this example, we'll use <code>/ora8/m02/oradata/ora8/</code>.<p>
     <li> Create the directory for the datafile.  <p>
	 To do this, exit from <code>svrmgrl</code> and login as <b>root</b> for this step.
<pre>
SVRMGR> exit
$ su -
; Enter root password.
# mkdir -p /ora8/m02/oradata/ora8/
# chown nsadmin.web /ora8/m02/oradata/ora8
# chmod 775 /ora8/m02/oradata/ora8
# exit
$
</pre>

     <li> As <b>nsadmin</b>, create a tablespace for the service.  It is important that
the tablespace can <code>autoextend</code>.  This allows the tablespace's 
storage capacity to grow as the size of the data grows. We set the 
pctincrease to be a very low value so that our extents won't grow 
geometrically. We do not set it to 0 at the tablespace level because this 
would affect Oracle's ability to automatically coalesce free space in the
 tablespace.
<pre>
$ svrmgrl

SVRMGR> connect internal;
SVRMGR> create tablespace <i>service_name</i> datafile '/ora8/m02/oradata/ora8/<i>service_name</i>01.dbf' size
50m autoextend on default storage ( pctincrease 1);
</pre>
    <li> Create a database user for this service. Give the user access to the tablespace and rights to connect. (Substitute <code>database_password</code> with the appropriate password.)<p>
<b> Write down what you specify as <i>service_name</i> and 
<i>database_password</i></b>.  You will need this information for configuring
exports exports AOLServer.
<pre>
SVRMGR> create user <i>service_name</i> identified by <i>database_password</i> default tablespace <i>service_name</i>
temporary tablespace temp quota unlimited on <i>service_name</i>;
SVRMGR> grant connect, resource, ctxapp, javasyspriv, query rewrite to <i>service_name</i>;
SVRMGR> revoke unlimited tablespace from <i>service_name</i>;
SVRMGR> alter user <i>service_name</i> quota unlimited on <i>service_name</i>;
SVRMGR> exit;
</pre>
Your table space is now ready.  In case you are trying to delete a
	previous ACS installation, consult these commands in the
	<a href="#delete">appendix</a>.

</ul>
<a name="exports"></a>
<a href="#top">TOP</a><br><h3>Set up nightly Oracle exports</h3>
While you're working with Oracle, you should configure it to do automatic exports.  An
export is a separate backup copy of the database.  This copy includes all of the database's state at
the time that the export was initiated.  If your database is corrupted, you can restore from one of these
backups (see <a href="#transfer">appendix</a>).  You should do this step as <b>root</b>.
<ul>
<li>Download the backup script.  Save the file <a href="export-oracle.txt">export-oracle.txt</a> 
as <b>/tmp/export-oracle.txt</b>.
<li>Login as root.  The following commands will install the export script.
<pre>
$ su -
; Enter root password
# cp /tmp/export-oracle.txt /usr/sbin/export-oracle
# chmod 700 /usr/sbin/export-oracle
</pre>

<li> Setup the export directory.  This is the directory where backups will be stored.  We
recommend the directory <code>/ora8/m02/oracle-exports</code>.
<pre>
# mkdir /ora8/m02/oracle-exports
# chown oracle.dba /ora8/m02/oracle-exports
# chmod 770 /ora8/m02/oracle-exports
</pre>

<li> Now edit <code>/usr/sbin/export-oracle</code> and 
change the <code>SERVICE_NAME</code> and <code>DATABASE_PASSWORD</code> 
fields to their correct values.  If you want to use
a directory other than
<code>/ora8/m02/oracle-exports</code>, you also need to change the
<code>exportdir</code> setting.<p>
Test the export procedure by running the command. 
<pre>
# /usr/sbin/export-oracle
mv: /ora8/m02/oracle-exports/oraexport-service_name.dmp.gz: No such file or directory

If you don't have any warnings, proceed to automate the backups.    <p>
    
<li> Automating backups is accomplished using the UNIX <b>crontab</b> facility.<p>
While still as <b>root</b> run the following command.  You can replace
the <code>EDITOR="emacs -nw"</code> portion with whatever editor your
prefer, such as <code>EDITOR=vi</code>.
<pre>
# export EDITOR="emacs -nw"
# crontab -e</pre>
Now add the following line on a line by itself
<pre>
0 23 * * * /usr/sbin/export-oracle
</pre>

Save the file, exit the editor.  Verify that the addition succeeded by
checking the output of the following command.
<pre>
# crontab -l | grep export-oracle
0 23 * * * /usr/sbin/export-oracle
# exit
; Logout
</pre>
If you see the line, go ahead and log out.

<a name="configuring"></a>
<a href="#top">TOP</a><br><h3>Configuring AOLServer</h3><p>
The AOLServer architecture lets you run an arbitrary number of virtual
servers.  A virtual server is an HTTP service running on a specific 
port, e.g. port 80.  In order for the ACS to work, you need to 
configure a virtual server.  Because the process is involved, we
have prepared a sample virtual server configuration file.  



<ul>
<li>Allot an IP address

You must know what IP address has been assigned to your system.  
If you don't know, contact your system administrator and find out.
If you do not have a network connection, use <code>localhost 127.0.0.1</code>
Once you have installed a virtual server as described below, you should notify 
your sysadmin that you have claimed this IP. 

<p>
<li> Save the template configuration file <a href="template-ini.ini">template-ini.ini</a>
into <b>/tmp</b>.
<p><li> Login as <b>nsadmin</b>.
<pre>
$ cp /tmp/template-ini.ini /home/aol30/<i>service_name</i>.ini
</pre>

<p><li> Replace the following variables in the file as dictated below
    using a text editor.  You must specify a service port for your web server to run.  The standard HTTP
port number is port 80.  If you are already running a web server (such as 
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>, then port 80 is likely no longer available.
We recommend setting the service port to <code>8080</code> for a first time installation.
No other service uses this port and special access is not required to use it.  If you
want to use port 80, please read this <a href="#port80">appendix</a>.

<a name="troubleshooting"></a>
<a href="#top">TOP</a><br><h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

If you can't get to the login page, check for one of the below errors:
<p>
<ul>
<li>You see a page with the message <b>Error Serving Group Pages</b>.<p>
Take the following actions:
<ol>
<li>Edit <code>/home/aol30/<i>service_name</i>.ini</code> Make sure that
there is a line <code>auxconfigdir=/web/service_name/parameters</code> and that it
is correct.
<li>Make sure that there is a file <code>/web/service_name/parameters/service_name.ini</code>.
Edit this file and replace the default values if necessary.
<li>Kill your old AOLServer and restart it using the commands above for testing it.
</ol><p>
<li>If you don't see a page at all.<p>
Check the log file.  Make sure there is a line like:
<pre>
Notice: nssock: listening on http://localhost.localdomain:8000
</pre>
If you can't find this line, look for a line specifying an error listening to a port.  Such errors
are caused if another process is listening to that port or if you don't have permission
to access the port.  Try using another port, perhaps 8086.  You specify the port in 
<code>/home/aol30/service_name.ini</code> under <code>[ns/server/service_name/module/nssock]</code>
Here is a sample for a computer programmed to listen to 127.0.0.1:8080.  Try replacing the entries
in your file with this one.
<pre>
[ns/server/service_name/module/nssock]
timeout=120
Address=127.0.0.1
Hostname=127.0.0.1
Port=8080
</pre>
<li> Carefully scan the error log file for other entries flagged as errors.  If you
can't figure out what is wrong, try posting to the <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/bboard/q-and-a.tcl?topic_id=21">web/db bboard</a>.
</ul>

aolserver processes are killed regardless of who owns them.  However
the script should be executable by the <b>web</b> group to ensure 
that the users updating the web page can use the script, but that general system
users cannot run the script.  You also need to have Perl installed
and also a symbolic link to it in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.

<a name="transfer"></a>
<a href="#top">TOP</a><br><h3>Appendix A: How to Transfer Data</h3> 

If you are moving the service from one location to another, export code for the old database and 
import into the new.  If your database has been hosed and you want to restore a backup, use
the <code>imp</code> command.  These commands can be run from the shell, you don't need to 
use <code>sqlplus</code>.

To export:<pre>
exp <i>service_name</i>/<i>database_password</i> file=foo.dmp consistent=y full=y
</pre>
<p>
To  import:
<pre>
imp <i>service_name</i>/<i>database_password</i> file=foo.dmp [fromuser=olduser touser=<i>service_name</i>]
</pre>


<a name="port80"></a>
<a href="#top">TOP</a><br><h3>Appendix B: Running AOLServer on Port 80</h3>

If you want to run the service on port 80 (the default HTTP port), you
need to add some additional settings to your <code>service_name.ini</code> file in <code>/home/aol30</code>.
Under the <code>[ns/parameters]</code> section,  ensure that there is an entry
<pre>
User=nsadmin
</pre>

Moreover, you will need to start the service as <b>root</b>.  If you
follow the instructions above for <a href="#startup">automating startup</a>, this will be 
taken care of, but if you ever start the server from the command line,
be sure to <b>su -</b> first.<p>

These steps are required because port 80 is a <em> privileged</em> port.  Only certain users can claim 
it.  When you start <b>nsd</b> as root, it obtains the port, and then changes to run as whatever 
user you specify in the server configuration file.  This ensures a high level of security, as the server, 
once started, is not running as <b>root</b>.  This mean that if someone was able to exploit 
your web server to execute a command on your server, they would not be able to gain <b>root</b> access.

<a href="#top">TOP</a><br><h3>Appendix C: Deleting a tablespace</h3>
Should it become necessary to rebuild a tablespace from scratch, you
can use the <code>drop user</code> command with the <code>cascade</code>
option.  This command will drop the user and every database object the user owns.
<pre>drop user <i>service_name</i> cascade; </pre>
<p>If this does not work because svrmgrl "cannot drop a user that is
currently connected", make sure to kill the AOLServer using this user.
If it still does not work, do:
<p>
<pre> select username, sid, serial# from v$session where username='<i>service_name</i>'; </pre> <p>
and then 
<p>
<pre>alter system kill session '<i>sid</i>,<i>serial#</i>';</pre>
<p>
where <i>sid</i> and <i>serial#</i> are replaced with the corresponding values for the open session.
<p><b>Use with caution!</b><p>
If you feel the need to delete <i>everything</i> related to the service, you can also issue the following:
<pre>
drop tablespace <i>service_name</i> including contents cascade constraints;
</pre>
