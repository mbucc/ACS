# The order that we're trying to reauthorize is the 'in_basket' order for their user_session_id
# because orders are put back into the 'in_basket' state when their authorization fails

# We can't just update ec_creditcards with the new info because there might be a previous
# order which points to this credit card, so insert a new row into ec_creditcards.
# Obvious mistypes (wrong # of digits, etc.) will be weeded out before this point anyway,
# so the ec_creditcards table shouldn't get too huge.

# do all the normal url/cookie surgery checks
# except don't bother with the ones unneccessary for security (like "did they put in an address for
# this order?") because finalize-order.tcl (which they'll be going through to authorize their credit
# card) will take care of those.

# we need them to be logged in
